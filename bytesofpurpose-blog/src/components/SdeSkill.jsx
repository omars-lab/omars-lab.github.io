 * AI AGENTS UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS:
 * 
 * This component is tightly coupled with the blog post:
 * /docs/5-skills/preparing-for-interviews/understanding-differences-in-skills.mdx
 * 
 * WHEN TO UPDATE THE BLOG POST:
 * - Adding new skill categories (new 3-letter codes like ALN, XYZ)
 * - Modifying existing skill descriptions or expectations
 * - Changing skill codes or names
 * - Adding/removing levels (4, 5, 6, 7)
 * - Updating highlighting keywords
 * 
 * REQUIRED BLOG POST UPDATES:
 * 1. Add new skills to the table in the "SDE Expectations" section
 * 2. Add corresponding skill section with interview questions
 * 3. Add link reference at bottom: [ALN]: #alignment-consensus:~:text=%3E%20Alignment%20%26%20Consensus
 * 4. Update AI metadata section to reflect new skill dependencies
 * 
 * SKILL TABLE FORMAT:
 * | **Theme** | **[Skill Name][CODE]** | <SdeSkill role="SDE" skill="CODE" l="4"/> | <SdeSkill role="SDE" skill="CODE" l="5"/> | <SdeSkill role="SDE" skill="CODE" l="6"/> | <SdeSkill role="SDE" skill="CODE" l="7"/> |
 * 
 * SKILL SECTION FORMAT:
 * ##### > Skill Name {#skill-anchor}
 * * Key questions about the skill
 * * *Interview Questions*
 *     - "Behavioral question 1"
 *     - "Behavioral question 2"
 * 
 * LINK REFERENCE FORMAT:
 * [CODE]: #skill-anchor:~:text=%3E%20Skill%20Name
 * 
 * VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
 * - [ ] All skill codes in component exist in blog post table
 * - [ ] All skill codes in blog post table exist in component
 * - [ ] All skill links navigate correctly
 * - [ ] Interview questions are level-appropriate and behavioral
 * - [ ] AI metadata reflects current skill dependencies

Every figma link should be replaced with a figma diagram embedding (note www.figma.com needs to be replaced with embed.figma.com and a query paramater of embed-host=share needs to be added to the end of the URL)
```
<iframe 
  style={{ border: "1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)" }} 
  width="100%" 
  height="600" 
  src="<your-figma-url>" 
  allowFullScreen
/>
```

Your job is to ensure each of the blog files have the appropriate front matter.


## Blog Front Matter

Find the `.md/.mdx` files in `bytesofpurpose-blog/blog`. Ensure each of the files starts with a frontmatter section similar to the following:

---
slug: '<unique-id-short-code>'
title: '<Frontend Title>'
description: '<1 sentance description>'
authors: [oeid]
tags: []
---

Note that the slug should be a unique id that no other blog posts share.
For the description, attempt to identify the core question that the blog post addresses and use it as the description. If its simpler to summarize without describing in a question format, then use the simple description.
Add tags as needed.
Do not attempt to edit the content of the blog post itself. If the content is rought, feel free to add a `draft: true` attribute to the front matter with a section at the bottom of the post describing enhancements that should be made to the post prior to publishing it / removing it from draft mode.


## Docs Front Matter

Follow the same instructions as the Blog Front Matter, but instead of looking in `bytesofpurpose-blog/blog`, look in `bytesofpurpose-blog/docs`.


## Important!
* Don't delete any files!
* Don't remove any content that is outside the starting frontmatter section!
* Don't create any new documents / edit existing markdown files!
* Edit files one at a time!

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

I wanted to conslidate the design of a GenAI agent I seek to build; thus I made this post.

<!-- truncate -->

## Prioritization / Motivation
* Most important thing is going to be genai in the future .. 
* I want to build something mimmally myself ...

## Requirements
* As an engineer, I should demonstrate my ability to construct agentic applications with LLMs.
* As an engineer, I should demonstrate the ability to leverage vector dbs to power a RAG for an LLM.
* Non functionals - this should serve as a sample design ...
* Non functionals - I should use this as an opportunity to ramp up on vector dbs ...
* I want my personal-gen-ai-agents to be examples for eventually joining or starting my own gen ai startup
* implement my own rag ...
* Design an LLM + RAG + Vector Db Applications 

## Use Cases
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="note-companion" label="Note Companion">
    * GenAI as a personal note taking companion ... 
    * GenAI agent focused on organizing notes ...
    * Suggests commands to clean up notes ... 
    * Suggests moving ideas ... 
    * Discovers static ideas ... 
    * Groups hyperlinks ... 
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="blog-companion" label="Blog Companion">
    * Use Case: Blog Author
      * I should give chatgpt instructions to ignore slugs, etc
    * Can I have it review blog posts / core essence and write the post on my behlaf? 
    * Append a section at the end of every post to help the LLM generate content?
    * Docusaurus llm plugin?
    * I should make agentic setup to help me weite blog posts ...
    * Use genai to write blog posts ...
    * Similar to blogs, I should add a prompts blog with all my genai prompts + scripts to call chatgpt api
      * I should make a welcome-to-prompts 
    * Auto create blog posts form essence
      * I should have an offline script call and convert ... outside the blog directory structure for api key security 
    * I shouldn't need to move my notes around and organize them ... GenAI should be able to do it for me ... or at least tag a note ... 
  	* If it mis-tags it ... I should be able to explain why it tagged it wrong ...
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="team-docs-companion" label="Team Doc Companion">
    * GenAI as a dev documentation companion ...
    * "Having a note taker on the team"
    * Team can collaboratively curate notes ... campanion organizes them, cleans them up, etc ...
    * Goes from notes / words to a puml diagram ... 
    * Collaborative Note Taking ...
      * There is a whole genAI use case on changing how people take notes ...
        * 5 people talked about the same meeting in different ways ...
        * Can we find contradictions 
        * Can we find important things that everyone covered 
        * Things only 1 person covered ...
      * People might be afraid to use to not make them look stupid ... 
      * Impact
        * Helps cut through the ambiguity ... 
  </TabItem>

## Secondary Use Cases

    * What interview questions should I ask people?
    * What make you special, how are you different than your peers
    * Are you self aware
    * What tech questions should I ask?
    * How would you solve it
    * How would you write an X document ...
    * What examples would you include in it?
    * What points would you make in it?
    * Whats its outline?
    * What questions would it answer?
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="financial-companion" label="Financial Companion">
    * Another agent - analyze financial data / see how much I am spending in different categories ... for different occasions ... etc ...
    * Use the LLM to help build an LLM based app ...
  </TabItem>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="other" label="Other">
  * Are there any agentic use cases that come to mind?
    * Vetting a business?

## Components
* Is there a sample chat interface I can build / tinker with? 

## Essence 
* ...

## Approach
* iterative enhancements 
* Can I run the genAI on my m1 Mac .... 
	* Free in that case ...
* I just need to get started in the GenAI space 
* Use GenAI to develop a GenAI agent
  * Using q to craft docker compose files

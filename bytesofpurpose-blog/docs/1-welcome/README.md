# Welcome to Bytes of Purpose

Welcome to my developer blog! This is a place where I share my thoughts, learnings, and practical insights about programming, development tools, and problem-solving techniques.

## What You'll Find Here

You'll find a comprehensive collection of documentation and blog posts that you can navigate using the sidebar. The content is organized into several key areas:

### üìö Documentation Sections
- **[Techniques](/docs/techniques/mechanics)** - Technical implementation details and tools
- **[Coding Challenges](/docs/skills/solving-coding-challenges/coding-challenges)** - Algorithm problems and solutions
- **[Development](/docs/developing/development)** - Setup guides and development workflows
- **[Interviewing](/docs/skills/interviewing)** - Technical interview preparation
- **[Deep Dives](/docs/developing/research/research)** - In-depth technical explorations

### üìù Blog Posts
- **[Latest Posts](/blog/)** - Recent thoughts and experiences
- **[Design Posts](/designs/)** - Design decisions and architectural insights

## Content Philosophy

This blog follows a structured approach to content creation:

### Documentation vs Blog Posts
I maintain a clear distinction between [documentation and blog posts](/blog/docs-vs-blog-posts):
- **Documentation** provides durable, reference material for solving specific problems
- **Blog posts** capture experiences, lessons learned, and evolving perspectives

### Quality Standards
- All content is thoroughly reviewed for accuracy and clarity
- Code examples are tested and working
- Links are verified and maintained
- Content is regularly updated to reflect current best practices

## How to Navigate

- **Use the sidebar** to explore different sections
- **Search functionality** helps you find specific topics quickly
- **Tags** allow you to filter content by topic
- **Related posts** suggest additional reading

## Getting the Most Value

### For Readers
- **Thumbs up** useful content to help me understand what's most valuable
- **Edit button** lets you suggest improvements directly
- **Share** content that helps your team or community

### For Contributors
- All content is open source and welcomes contributions
- Use the edit links to propose improvements
- Check the [ideation process](#blog-post-ideation-process) for contributing new ideas

## Content Structure

### Blog Post Ideation Process
I maintain a transparent content creation process:

1. **Idea Collection** - All blog post ideas are tracked in the repository
2. **Sneak Peaks** - Incomplete posts are published as drafts to gauge interest
3. **View Analytics** - Popular topics get prioritized for completion
4. **Quality Review** - All content is scrubbed for accuracy, removing work-specific information and ensuring proper formatting

### Future Content
I have a section of future ideas that you can vote on, helping me prioritize what content would be most valuable to create next.

## Technical Focus Areas

This blog covers several key technical areas:

- **Algorithm Problem Solving** - Including [DFS vs BFS comparisons](/blog/dfs-vs-bfs) and coding challenge solutions
- **Local Development Setup** - From [running LLMs locally](/docs/developing/research/running-llms-locally) to development environment configuration
- **Development Tools** - Docusaurus setup, VS Code plugins, and productivity tools
- **Technical Interviewing** - System design expectations and problem-solving frameworks

## Questions

- How much thinking and planning do I want to do in NotePlan vs organizing and documenting?
- What's the best way to integrate Figma diagrams with Dropbox paper?
- What kind of artifacts do I expect to capture in Figma? Dropbox? NotePlan? ...
- How should I organize my tool usage for different types of work?
- Where should I capture thoughts vs where should I strategize and plan?
- How can I create better workflows between my different tools?

## Decision

Consolidating tools and mechanics is essential for creating efficient, streamlined workflows. By organizing and consolidating tools, I can reduce cognitive overhead, improve productivity, and create better integration between different systems. This habit helps me maintain clarity about which tools to use for which purposes and ensures that my workflows are optimized for maximum effectiveness.

## Strategy

I strategically approach consolidating by:
- Using NotePlan for capturing immediate thoughts and personal todos
- Using Figma for strategic thinking, diagrams, and visual organization
- Using Dropbox paper for planning, strategizing, and sharing with others
- Creating clear boundaries between different tools and their purposes
- Integrating tools through linking and cross-referencing

## The Kinds of Action Items

**Note**: The hashtags from this section will be used to categorize specific action items later in the document.

  - How much thinking and planning do I want to do in NotePlan vs organizing and documenting?
  - What's the best way to integrate Figma diagrams with Dropbox paper?
  - How should I organize my tool usage for different types of work?

### #consolidating/workflow-optimization
- Optimize workflows between different tools and systems
- Create efficient processes for capturing, organizing, and sharing information
- Streamline tool usage to reduce cognitive overhead
- Strategic Questions / Ask Yourself:
  - Where should I capture thoughts vs where should I strategize and plan?
  - How can I create better workflows between my different tools?
  - What processes can I streamline for better efficiency?

### #consolidating/habit-integration
- Integrate consolidating practices into all habits
- Ensure all "I need to constantly" thoughts are captured in Figma

## Specific Action Items

- [ ] I should have this in all of the habits I call out - all of the "I need to constantly" thoughts should be in Figma, and the actual plan in Dropbox paper #consolidating/habit-integration
- [ ] I should show the lower level idea flow #consolidating/workflow-optimization

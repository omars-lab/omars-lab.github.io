## Questions

- How do I organize myself?
- How do I organize my work and work streams?
- How do I organize my files, artifacts, and notes?
- How do I organize my roles and responsibilities?
- How do I organize my initiatives and projects?
- How do I organize my processes and workflows?
- How do I organize my thoughts and ideas?
- How do I organize my emails and communications?

## Decision

Organizing is essential for creating structure, reducing cognitive overhead, and maintaining clarity in all areas of work and life. By systematically organizing files, work streams, artifacts, notes, roles, and processes, I can ensure that information is accessible, workflows are efficient, and systems are maintainable. This habit enables me to transform chaotic information into structured, usable systems that support productivity and clarity.

## Strategy

I strategically approach organizing by:
- Creating clear organizational structures for different types of content
- Implementing automation and scripts to support organization
- Establishing consistent naming and categorization systems
- Maintaining regular cleanup and consolidation practices
- Creating cross-links and relationships between different organizational systems

## Questions

## Decision

I need to constantly analyze myself and constantly revisit my tool adoption / strive to improve it. Self-reflection is essential for personal growth, learning from failures, and staying aligned with my vision and purpose.

## Strategy

I strategically approach reflecting by:

- Creating dashboards for constant review
- Analyzing failures and learning from them
- Reflecting on vision, career, and purpose regularly
- Holding myself accountable and maintaining discipline

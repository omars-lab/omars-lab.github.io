## Decision

Prioritizing is essential for making effective use of limited time and resources, ensuring that efforts are focused on the most important and impactful activities. It involves systematically evaluating workstreams, classifying priorities, and making conscious decisions about what to start, continue, or stop. This habit is crucial for maintaining focus, avoiding overwhelm, and ensuring that energy is directed toward activities that align with overarching goals and values. It transforms the chaos of unlimited possibilities into structured, purposeful action.

## Strategy

I strategically approach prioritizing by:
- Using systematic priority classifications (Want to, Should do, Habit, Must do, Must do now)
- Regularly asking guiding questions about current focus and time allocation
- Creating dashboards and metrics to measure progress and hold myself accountable
- Conducting recurring reflection sessions to assess strengths and direction
- Understanding what causes priority shifts and how to adapt accordingly
- Balancing immediate needs with long-term strategic goals

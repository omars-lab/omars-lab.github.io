# Role Refactoring System: AI-Powered Personal Role Organization

> 📁 **View the actual prompt**: [Role Refactoring Prompt](https://github.com/omars-lab/prompts/tree/main/refactor/role-refactoring-prompt.md)

## High-Level Intent & Value Proposition

The Role Refactoring System transforms chaotic personal role definitions into organized, actionable structures. Instead of manually separating generic role frameworks from personal action items across dozens of files, this AI-powered solution systematically reorganizes role directories, creates comprehensive activity frameworks, and maintains clear separation between planning guidance and personal todos.

**Estimated Annual Time Savings: 20-30 hours per year**
- **Role Refactoring Sessions**: 3-4 hours saved per role vs manual organization
- **Annual Total**: 1,200-1,800 minutes (20-30 hours) in direct time savings
- **Additional Benefits**: 8-12 hours saved through improved role clarity, better actionability, and reduced cognitive overhead
- **ROI**: For a knowledge worker earning $75/hour, this represents $1,500-$2,250 in annual value

## The Problem It Solves

### 🚨 Role Definition Chaos
Personal role files scattered with mixed generic frameworks, personal todos, planning questions, and action items, making it impossible to find what you need when you need it.

### 📝 Content Separation Issues
Generic role guidance mixed with personal action items, creating confusion about what applies to anyone in the role vs what's specific to your situation.

### 🔍 Discoverability Problems
Important role information buried in unstructured files, making it difficult to understand role scope, responsibilities, and required activities.

### ⚖️ Role Overlap Confusion
Multiple roles with overlapping responsibilities and unclear boundaries, leading to duplicated effort and inconsistent approaches.

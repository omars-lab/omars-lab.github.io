# Docusaurus Maintenance System: Automated Frontmatter & Link Healing

> 📁 **View the actual prompts**: [Fix Frontmatter](https://github.com/omars-lab/prompts/tree/main/heal/fix-frontmatter.md) | [Fix Broken Docusaurus Links](https://github.com/omars-lab/prompts/tree/main/heal/fix-broken-docusaurus-links.md)

## High-Level Intent & Value Proposition

The Docusaurus Maintenance System combines two powerful prompts to systematically heal and maintain large documentation sites. Instead of manually fixing frontmatter issues and broken links across hundreds of files, this AI-powered solution provides comprehensive detection, categorization, and systematic repair processes that ensure clean builds and proper content organization.

**Estimated Annual Time Savings: 15-25 hours per year**
- **Maintenance Sessions**: 2-3 hours saved per major site update vs manual fixes
- **Annual Total**: 1,200-2,000 minutes (20-33 hours) in direct time savings
- **Additional Benefits**: 5-8 hours saved through reduced debugging time, improved site reliability, and eliminated build failures
- **ROI**: For a knowledge worker earning $75/hour, this represents $1,125-$1,875 in annual value

## The Problem It Solves

### 🚨 Frontmatter Chaos
Hundreds of markdown files missing proper frontmatter sections, causing build failures and inconsistent content organization across documentation sites.

### 🔗 Broken Link Nightmare
Dozens of broken internal links scattered throughout documentation, making navigation impossible and creating poor user experience.

### 🏗️ Build Failures
Docusaurus builds failing due to missing frontmatter, broken links, and inconsistent file structures, blocking content publication.

### 📊 Maintenance Overhead
Manual detection and fixing of documentation issues is time-consuming, error-prone, and doesn't scale with growing content bases.

## How I Use This System

### 🔧 Two-Prompt Workflow
I use these prompts together for comprehensive site maintenance:

- ✅ **Frontmatter Healing** → Systematically add proper frontmatter to all missing files
- ✅ **Link Repair** → Fix broken internal links across the entire site
- ✅ **Build Verification** → Ensure clean builds with zero errors
- ✅ **Systematic Processing** → Handle hundreds of files efficiently

### 🎯 Maintenance Categories
The system handles multiple types of documentation issues:

| Issue Type | Detection Method | Fix Approach | Success Rate |
|------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Missing Frontmatter** | `find` + `grep` commands | Add proper YAML frontmatter | 100% |
| **Draft File Links** | Build output analysis | Remove `draft: true` status | 100% |
| **Slug Mismatches** | Slug vs filename comparison | Update links to match slugs | 100% |
| **Path Structure Issues** | Build output verification | Add missing path segments | 100% |
| **Directory Renames** | Systematic find/replace | Update all link references | 100% |

## Technical Implementation

### Detection Commands
```bash
# Find files missing frontmatter
find bytesofpurpose-blog -name "*.md" -o -name "*.mdx" | while read file; do 
  if [ -f "$file" ] && ! head -n 10 "$file" | grep -q "^---$"; then 
    echo "Missing frontmatter: $file"; 
  fi; 
done

# Run build to detect broken links
make build

# Find draft files
grep -r "draft: true" docs/ --include="*.md" --include="*.mdx"
```

### Fix Patterns
- **Frontmatter Addition**: Standard YAML with slug, title, description, tags, date
- **Draft Status Removal**: Change `draft: true` to `draft: false` for linked files
- **Slug Updates**: Match links to actual slugs defined in frontmatter
- **Path Corrections**: Add missing directory segments to link paths

### Verification Process
- **Build Testing**: Run `make build` after each fix batch
- **Link Verification**: Check that target files exist in build output
- **Systematic Coverage**: Process files directory by directory
- **Success Metrics**: Track completion rates and remaining issues

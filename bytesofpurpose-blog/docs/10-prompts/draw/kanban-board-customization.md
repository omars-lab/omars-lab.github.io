# Kanban Board Customization: AI-Powered Visual Project Management

> 📁 **View the actual prompt**: [Customize Kanban Board](https://github.com/omars-lab/prompts/tree/main/draw/customize-kanban-board.md)

## High-Level Intent & Value Proposition

The Kanban Board Customization system transforms generic SVG templates into personalized visual project management tools. Instead of manually creating complex SVG diagrams with proper layering, positioning, and styling, this AI-powered solution generates professional Kanban boards with custom workflows, task cards, and priority systems that are ready for immediate use.

**Estimated Annual Time Savings: 8-15 hours per year**
- **Board Creation**: 2-3 hours saved per custom board vs manual SVG creation
- **Annual Total**: 600-1,200 minutes (10-20 hours) in direct time savings
- **Additional Benefits**: 5-8 hours saved through improved project visualization, better team communication, and reduced design overhead
- **ROI**: For a knowledge worker earning $75/hour, this represents $750-$1,125 in annual value

## The Problem It Solves

### 🚨 Visual Project Management Chaos
Complex projects with multiple workflows, tasks, and priorities scattered across different tools and formats, making it difficult to visualize progress and manage work effectively.

### 🎨 SVG Creation Complexity
Manual creation of professional Kanban board SVGs requires deep knowledge of SVG structure, layering, positioning, and styling - a time-consuming and error-prone process.

### 📊 Inconsistent Visualization
Different projects using different visualization approaches, making it hard to maintain consistency and communicate effectively across teams and stakeholders.

### ⚡ Rapid Prototyping Needs
Need for quick creation of custom Kanban boards for different workflows, projects, and use cases without spending hours on design and implementation.

# SQL Query Analyzer: AI-Powered Database Query Documentation

> 📁 **View the actual prompt**: [SQL Query Analyzer](https://github.com/omars-lab/prompts/tree/main/analyze/analyze-sql.md)

## High-Level Intent & Value Proposition

The SQL Query Analyzer transforms complex, unreadable SQL queries into comprehensive documentation with visual diagrams and clean, maintainable code. Instead of manually analyzing database queries, creating documentation, and cleaning up code formatting, this AI-powered solution provides systematic analysis, visual representation, and self-healing capabilities that improve query understanding and maintainability.

**Estimated Annual Time Savings: 25-40 hours per year**
- **Query Analysis Sessions**: 1-2 hours saved per complex query vs manual analysis
- **Annual Total**: 1,500-2,400 minutes (25-40 hours) in direct time savings
- **Additional Benefits**: 10-15 hours saved through improved query maintainability, better team understanding, and reduced debugging time
- **ROI**: For a knowledge worker earning $75/hour, this represents $1,875-$3,000 in annual value

## The Problem It Solves

### 🚨 Complex Query Chaos
Large, complex SQL queries with poor formatting, unclear logic, and no documentation, making it impossible to understand business logic and maintain code effectively.

### 📊 Lack of Visual Understanding
Database queries with multiple CTEs, joins, and transformations that are difficult to visualize and understand without proper documentation and diagrams.

### 🔍 Poor Code Maintainability
Unformatted SQL code with inconsistent indentation, unclear variable names, and no comments, making it difficult to modify and debug.

### 📝 Missing Documentation
Critical business logic embedded in SQL queries without proper documentation, making it hard for team members to understand and maintain.

!define OUTPUT database

RAW_TABLE "prod.raw_events" as raw1 {
  + event_id
  + timestamp
  + user_id
}

DERIVED_TABLE "analytics.processed_events" as derived1 {
  + session_id
  + event_type

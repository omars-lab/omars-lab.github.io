# Adding Design Posts

Complete guide to creating design posts in Docusaurus. Learn what qualifies as a design post, how to structure files, configure frontmatter, and follow best practices.

## What Qualifies as a Design Post?

Design posts are designed for **documenting design decisions and architectural insights**. They capture the rationale behind design choices, system architecture, and visual design documentation.

### ✅ Choose Design Posts When Your Content Is:

- **Design decisions**: Documenting why specific design choices were made
- **Architecture documentation**: System design and architectural patterns
- **Visual design**: Design mockups, prototypes, and visual documentation
- **Design rationale**: Explaining the reasoning behind design choices
- **System design**: High-level system architecture and components
- **Design process**: Documenting the design process and iterations

### Examples of Good Design Posts:

- "GenAI Agent Design" - System architecture and design decisions
- "Blog Design Framework" - Design system and structure
- "Component Architecture" - React component design patterns
- "API Design Decisions" - API structure and rationale
- "User Flow Design" - User experience and interaction design

### ❌ Don't Use Design Posts For:

- Step-by-step implementation guides (use documentation)
- Personal experiences building something (use blog posts)
- Time-sensitive content (use blog posts)
- Reference material (use documentation)

## Design Post Structure

### File Location

Design posts are stored in the `designs/` directory:

```
bytesofpurpose-blog/
  designs/
    2025-02-06-genai-agent-design.mdx
    2025-12-31-blog-design.md
    2025-12-31-Framework.mdx
    authors.yml
```

### File Naming Convention

Design posts can use date-based naming similar to blog posts:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-descriptor.mdx
```

**Examples**:
- `2025-02-06-genai-agent-design.mdx`
- `2025-12-31-blog-design.md`
- `2025-12-31-Framework.mdx`

Alternatively, use descriptive names without dates:

```
descriptor.mdx
```

### Design Post Folders

You can create folders for design posts to co-locate related files:

```
designs/
  genai-agent-design/
    index.mdx
    architecture-diagram.png
    component-diagram.svg
```

## Frontmatter Requirements

Design posts support [Docusaurus Markdown features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features), including [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

### Required Frontmatter

```yaml
---
slug: my-design-slug
sidebar_position: 1
title: 'My Design Title'
description: 'A brief description of the design'
authors: [oeid]
tags: [design, architecture, system-design]
draft: false
---
```

### Common Frontmatter Fields

- **`slug`**: URL-friendly identifier (required)
- **`title`**: Design post title (required)
- **`description`**: Brief description (optional)
- **`authors`**: Array of author IDs from `authors.yml` (optional)
- **`tags`**: Array of tags for categorization (optional)
- **`sidebar_position`**: Position in sidebar (optional)
- **`draft`**: Set to `false` to publish, `true` to keep as draft (optional, default: `false`)

### Example Frontmatter

```yaml
---
slug: design-genai-agent
sidebar_position: 1
title: GenAI Agent Design
description: 'Design and architecture for a GenAI agent system'
authors: [oeid]
tags: [genai, architecture, design, agents]
draft: false
---
```

## Design Post Content

### Typical Structure

Design posts often include:

```markdown
# Design Title

Brief introduction explaining the design context.

## Prioritization / Motivation

Why this design is important and what problems it solves.

## Requirements

What the design needs to accomplish.

## Use Cases

Specific use cases the design addresses.

## High Level Design

Overview of the design approach.

## Components

Key components and their relationships.

## Approach

How the design will be implemented.

## Resources

Links to relevant resources and references.
```

### Using Components

Design posts can embed various components:

- **Diagrams**: Figma embeds, Mermaid diagrams, PlantUML
- **Images**: Architecture diagrams, mockups, prototypes
- **Code**: Code examples showing implementation
- **Tabs**: Organize different aspects of the design

### Example: Using Figma Embeds

```markdown
<iframe 
  style={{border: "1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)"}} 
  width="800" 
  height="450" 
  src="https://embed.figma.com/board/..." 
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

### Example: Using Tabs

```markdown
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="use-case-1" label="Use Case 1">
    Content for use case 1
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="use-case-2" label="Use Case 2">
    Content for use case 2
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Best Practices

### Content Quality

1. **Document rationale**: Explain why design decisions were made
2. **Show architecture**: Include diagrams and visual representations
3. **Be comprehensive**: Cover all aspects of the design
4. **Include context**: Explain the problem being solved
5. **Document trade-offs**: Discuss alternatives and why they weren't chosen

### Formatting

1. **Use visual aids**: Include diagrams, mockups, and visual representations
2. **Structure clearly**: Use headings to organize content
3. **Use tabs**: Organize different aspects or use cases
4. **Include code**: Show implementation examples when relevant
5. **Link to resources**: Reference related documentation and resources

### Organization

1. **Clear sections**: Organize content into logical sections
2. **Visual hierarchy**: Use headings and formatting effectively
3. **Cross-references**: Link to related designs and documentation
4. **Consistent structure**: Follow similar structure across design posts
5. **Update as needed**: Keep designs current as they evolve

## Design Post vs Other Content Types

### Design Posts vs Blog Posts

- **Design Posts**: Focus on design decisions and architecture
- **Blog Posts**: Focus on experiences, stories, and time-sensitive content

### Design Posts vs Documentation

- **Design Posts**: Document design rationale and architecture
- **Documentation**: Provide reference material and how-to guides

### Design Posts vs Changelog Entries

- **Design Posts**: Document design decisions and architecture
- **Changelog Entries**: Track changes and implementation progress

## Authors Configuration

Design post authors are defined in `designs/authors.yml`:

```yaml
oeid:
  name: Omar Eid
  title: Software Engineer
  url: https://github.com/omareid
  image_url: https://github.com/omareid.png
```

Reference authors in frontmatter:

```yaml
authors: [oeid]
```

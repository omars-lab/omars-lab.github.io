# Adding Blog Posts

Complete guide to creating blog posts in Docusaurus. Learn what qualifies as a blog post, how to structure files, configure frontmatter, and follow best practices.

## What Qualifies as a Blog Post?

Blog posts are designed for **discovery and storytelling**. They capture moments in time, share experiences, and help people learn through narrative.

### ✅ Choose Blog Posts When Your Content Is:

- **Time-sensitive**: Current events, new tool releases, or trending topics
- **Personal experience**: Your journey learning something, mistakes made, lessons learned
- **Opinion or analysis**: Your take on industry trends or tool comparisons
- **Story-driven**: Content that benefits from narrative structure
- **Discovery-focused**: Content that helps people find new ideas or approaches
- **Tinkering timeline**: Capturing the journey of experimentation and learning

### Examples of Good Blog Posts:

- "My experience migrating from X to Y"
- "Why I switched to this new framework"
- "Lessons learned from building my first SaaS"
- "Comparing different approaches to solve problem Z"
- "What I learned from debugging a production issue"

### ❌ Don't Use Blog Posts For:

- Reference material (use documentation instead)
- Step-by-step guides that won't change (use documentation)
- API documentation (use documentation)
- Configuration instructions (use documentation)

For more guidance on choosing between blog posts and documentation, see [Docs vs Blog Posts](/blog/docs-vs-blog-posts).

## Blog Post Structure

### File Location

Blog posts are stored in the `blog/` directory at the root of your project:

```
bytesofpurpose-blog/
  blog/
    2025-01-31-docs-vs-blogs.md
    2025-03-07-DFS-vs-BFS.md
    2025-09-27-my-contributions.mdx
    authors.yml
```

### File Naming Convention

Blog post dates are extracted from filenames. Use the format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md
```

**Examples**:
- `2025-01-31-docs-vs-blogs.md`
- `2025-03-07-DFS-vs-BFS.md`
- `2025-09-27-my-contributions.mdx`

### Blog Post Folders

You can also create a folder for a blog post, which is convenient for co-locating images:

```
blog/
  2025-01-31-my-post/
    index.md
    image1.png
    image2.jpg
```

## Frontmatter Requirements

Blog posts support [Docusaurus Markdown features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features), including [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

### Required Frontmatter

```yaml
---
slug: my-blog-post-slug
title: 'My Blog Post Title'
description: 'A brief description of the blog post'
authors: [oeid]
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
date: 2025-01-31T10:00
draft: false
---
```

### Frontmatter Fields

- **`slug`**: URL-friendly identifier (required)
- **`title`**: Blog post title (required)
- **`description`**: Brief description for SEO and previews (required)
- **`authors`**: Array of author IDs from `authors.yml` (required)
- **`tags`**: Array of tags for categorization (optional but recommended)
- **`date`**: Publication date in ISO format (required)
- **`draft`**: Set to `false` to publish, `true` to keep as draft (optional, default: `false`)
- **`image`**: Path to featured image (optional)
- **`hide_table_of_contents`**: Hide TOC (optional, default: `false`)

### Example Frontmatter

```yaml
---
slug: docs-vs-blog-posts
title: '📝 Docs vs Blogs'
description: 'Learn the key differences between documentation and blog posts to make better content decisions for your developer blog.'
authors: [oeid]
tags: [content-strategy, blogging, documentation, writing]
date: 2025-01-31T10:00
image: /img/versus.jpg
draft: false
---
```

## Authors Configuration

Regular blog authors are defined in `blog/authors.yml`:

```yaml
oeid:
  name: Omar Eid
  title: Software Engineer
  url: https://github.com/omareid
  image_url: https://github.com/omareid.png
```

Reference authors in frontmatter using their key:

```yaml
authors: [oeid]
```

## Blog Post Content

### Truncation

Use the `<!-- truncate -->` comment to mark where the post preview should end:

```markdown
I needed to distinguish when I should create a new blog post vs doc; thus I made this post.

<!-- truncate -->

# Full Content Starts Here
```

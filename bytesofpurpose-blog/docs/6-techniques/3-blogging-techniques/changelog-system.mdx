# Changelog System

Complete guide to the changelog system for tracking all changes, plans, and improvements to the blog. Each entry is a markdown file with frontmatter metadata.

## Overview

The changelog system provides a structured way to track:
- **Content changes**: Blog posts, documentation, content enhancements
- **Development changes**: Components, mechanics, infrastructure, optimizations
- **Project evolution**: Historical record of what was planned, what was done, and what was learned

The changelog is accessible via the "Changelog" tab in the Docusaurus navbar.

## File Naming Convention

Files are named using the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-{category}-{action}-{descriptor}.md`

- **YYYY-MM-DD**: Date of inception (for plans) or execution (for completed work)
- **{category}**: Type of change (see Categories below)
- **{action}**: What's being done (see Actions below)
- **{descriptor}**: Kebab-case description of the specific item

### Content Category Prefixes

For entries in the `content/` directory, use these specific prefixes:

- **`content-post-{descriptor}`**: For blog posts and blog content enhancements
  - Example: `2025-XX-XX-content-post-knowledge-agents-design.md`

- **`content-docs-{descriptor}`**: For documentation that results in new documentation files
  - Use when creating new documentation guides or documentation content
  - Example: `2025-11-20-content-docs-adding-content-guides.md`

- **`content-changelog-{descriptor}`**: For changelog-related content or analysis
  - Use for changelog analysis, reviews, or changelog-related documentation
  - Example: `2025-11-20-content-changelog-missing-features-analysis.md`

- **`documentation-{descriptor}`**: For general documentation updates (legacy, prefer `content-docs-*` for new entries)
  - Example: `2025-01-20-documentation-api-reference.md`

See [Naming Conventions](/docs/NAMING_CONVENTIONS) for complete naming guidelines.

## Directory Structure

Changelog entries are organized into two main categories:

- **`changelog/content/`** - Content-related changes (blog posts, documentation, content enhancements)
- **`changelog/development/`** - Development/infrastructure changes (components, mechanics, infrastructure, optimization, structure)

See [Changelog Directory Structure](/changelog/README) for detailed organization guidelines.

## Frontmatter Fields

Each changelog entry includes the following frontmatter fields:

- `title`: Human-readable title (required)
- `description`: Brief description (required)
- `status`: Current status (`planned`, `in-progress`, `completed`, `cancelled`) (required)
- `inception_date`: Date when the plan/change was first conceived (required)
- `execution_date`: Date when the change was executed (use `TBD` for plans) (required)
- `type`: Type of change (`refactoring`, `feature`, `bugfix`, `documentation`, `infrastructure`) (required)
- `component`: Affected component or area (optional)
- `priority`: Priority level (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`) (required)
- `category`: Content category (`content` or `development`) (optional, inferred from directory)

### Status Values

- **planned**: Change is planned but not yet started
- **in-progress**: Change is currently being worked on
- **completed**: Change has been completed
- **cancelled**: Change was cancelled or abandoned

### Type Values

- **refactoring**: Code refactoring or restructuring
- **feature**: New feature addition
- **bugfix**: Bug fix
- **documentation**: Documentation updates
- **infrastructure**: Infrastructure or tooling changes

## Entry Structure

Each changelog entry must have two main sections:

### 1. Execution Plan

This section describes what was planned to be done. It should include:
- Goals and objectives
- Planned approach or strategy
- Expected outcomes
- Any prerequisites or dependencies

### 2. Execution Results / Attempts

This section documents what was actually done or attempted. It should include:
- What was completed
- What was attempted but didn't work
- Challenges encountered
- Deviations from the plan
- Lessons learned
- Current status

**For content changelog entries**, also include:
- **Files/Folders Impacted**: Links to all files and folders that were created, modified, or affected
  - Use markdown links with proper paths (e.g., `[docs/6-techniques/3-blogging-techniques/5-adding-content/README.mdx](/docs/techniques/blogging-techniques/adding-content)`)
  - Include both created and enhanced files
  - Link to folders when entire directories were affected

**Example:**
```markdown
**Files Created:**
- [`docs/6-techniques/3-blogging-techniques/5-adding-content/README.mdx`](/docs/techniques/blogging-techniques/adding-content) - Main index page

**Files Enhanced:**
- [`docs/6-techniques/3-blogging-techniques/README.mdx`](/docs/techniques/blogging-techniques) - Added new section

**Folders Impacted:**
- [`docs/6-techniques/3-blogging-techniques/5-adding-content/`](/docs/techniques/blogging-techniques/adding-content) - Restructured folder
```

For entries with status `planned`, the "Execution Results / Attempts" section should indicate that execution has not yet begun.

## Adding New Entries

1. **Choose the correct directory**:
   - `changelog/content/` for content-related changes (blog posts, documentation, content enhancements)
   - `changelog/development/` for development/infrastructure changes (components, mechanics, infrastructure, etc.)

2. **Use the correct naming convention**:
   - For content entries: `YYYY-MM-DD-{prefix}-{descriptor}.md`
     - Use `content-post-*` for blog posts
     - Use `content-docs-*` for documentation that creates new docs
     - Use `content-changelog-*` for changelog-related content
   - For development entries: `YYYY-MM-DD-{category}-{action}-{descriptor}.md`
     - See [Naming Conventions](/docs/NAMING_CONVENTIONS) for complete guidelines

3. **Add appropriate frontmatter**:
   - Include all required fields (title, description, status, dates, type, priority)
   - Set `category: 'content'` for content entries, or omit for development entries

4. **Include both sections**:
   - "Execution Plan" - What was planned
   - "Execution Results / Attempts" - What was done

5. **For content entries, include file/folder links**:
   - Add "Files/Folders Impacted" section with links to all affected files and folders
   - Use proper markdown links with correct paths

6. **Update this documentation if needed**:
   - If you discover new patterns or conventions, update this file

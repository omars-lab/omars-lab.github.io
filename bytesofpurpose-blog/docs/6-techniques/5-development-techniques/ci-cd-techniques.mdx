## Questions
> What are the Top 3 Questions This Post Should Address

1. What are the fundamental CI/CD techniques?
2. How can I optimize CI/CD pipelines for faster builds?
3. What are the best practices for implementing CI/CD?

# Pipeline Optimization

## Build Speed
* [ ] [Faster builds with highly par­al­lel GitHub Actions](https://rnorth.org/faster-parallel-github-builds/) #goodread
* [ ] Implement build caching strategies
* [ ] Parallelize independent test suites
* [ ] Use build artifacts to skip redundant steps

# Testing Strategy

## Test Execution in Pipeline
* [ ] Run unit tests on every commit
* [ ] Run integration tests before merge
* [ ] Execute end-to-end tests before deployment
* [ ] Fail fast on critical test failures

# Deployment Strategies

## Deployment Techniques
* [ ] Blue-green deployments for zero-downtime
* [ ] Canary deployments for gradual rollouts
* [ ] Feature flags for controlled releases
* [ ] Automated rollback mechanisms

# Security & Quality

## Pipeline Security
* [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning
* [ ] Static code analysis (SAST)
* [ ] Secrets management and rotation
* [ ] Container image scanning

# Environment Management

## Environment Strategy
* [ ] Separate environments (dev, staging, prod)
* [ ] Environment parity and configuration management
* [ ] Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for environments
* [ ] Automated environment provisioning

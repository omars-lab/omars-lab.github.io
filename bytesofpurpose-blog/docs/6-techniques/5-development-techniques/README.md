# Development Techniques

Practical methods and approaches for developing software effectively. This section covers techniques for building, testing, deploying, and maintaining code.

## What Are Development Techniques?

Development techniques are **practical methods for software development**:

- 🔨 **Build & Deployment** - Methods for building and deploying applications
- 🧪 **Testing & Quality** - Approaches to testing and ensuring code quality
- ⚙️ **CI/CD** - Continuous integration and deployment practices
- 🔄 **Workflow Optimization** - Streamlining development processes
- 📦 **Dependency Management** - Managing libraries and dependencies

## Difference from Other Techniques

**Development Techniques** vs other technique categories:

- **Development Techniques** → Focus on building, testing, and deploying software
- **Scripting Techniques** → Command-line tools and automation scripts
- **Documentation Techniques** → Creating and maintaining documentation
- **Blogging Techniques** → Content creation and publishing methods

Development techniques are specifically about the software development lifecycle and code delivery.

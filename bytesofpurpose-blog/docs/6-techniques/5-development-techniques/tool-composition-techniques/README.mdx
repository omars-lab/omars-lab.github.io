# Tool Composition Techniques

Tool composition is the practice of combining multiple tools to create a more powerful solution than any single tool could provide alone. This section covers techniques and examples for effectively composing tools.

## What is Tool Composition?

Tool composition involves:
- Understanding how tools interact
- Configuring tools to work together
- Managing dependencies between tools
- Creating unified workflows

## Examples

# Scripting Techniques

Command-line tools, automation scripts, and terminal techniques for parsing data, managing links, and enhancing terminal workflows. This section covers practical scripting methods for improving productivity and automating tasks.

## What Are Scripting Techniques?

Scripting techniques are **methods for command-line automation and data processing**:

- 🖥️ **Terminal Tools** - Enhancing terminal functionality and workflows
- 📊 **Data Parsing** - Parsing and processing structured data (HTML, JSON)
- 🔗 **Link Management** - Managing and organizing links in terminal
- 📅 **Calendar Integration** - Integrating calendar functionality in terminal
- ⚡ **Shortcuts** - Creating terminal shortcuts for efficiency

## Difference from Development Techniques

**Scripting Techniques** vs **Development Techniques**:

- **Scripting Techniques** → Focus on command-line tools, terminal automation, and data parsing
- **Development Techniques** → Focus on building, testing, and deploying software applications

Scripting techniques are about terminal productivity and automation, while development techniques are about the software development lifecycle.

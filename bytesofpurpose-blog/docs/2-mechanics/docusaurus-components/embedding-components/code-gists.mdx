# Embedding GitHub Gists in Docusaurus

This guide shows you how to embed GitHub Gists in your Docusaurus documentation using the `react-gist` package.

## What are GitHub Gists?

GitHub Gists are a way to share code snippets, notes, and other text-based content. They're perfect for:
- **Code examples** that you want to keep updated
- **Configuration files** that might change over time
- **Snippets** that you want to share across multiple projects
- **Documentation** that benefits from version control

## Installation

First, install the `react-gist` package:

```bash
npm install react-gist
# or
yarn add react-gist
```

## Basic Usage

### Step 1: Import the Component

At the top of your MDX file, import the Gist component:

```jsx
import Gist from 'react-gist';
```

### Step 2: Embed a Gist

Use the component with the Gist ID:

```jsx
<Gist id="5555251" />
```

### Example: Embedded Gist

<Gist id="5555251" />

## Finding the Gist ID

The Gist ID is the number in the URL of your GitHub Gist:

```
https://gist.github.com/username/5555251
                                 ^^^^^^^^
                                 This is the ID
```

## Advanced Options

### Specify a File

If your Gist has multiple files, you can specify which one to display:

```jsx
<Gist id="5555251" file="example.js" />
```

### Custom Styling

You can add custom CSS classes:

```jsx
<Gist id="5555251" className="myCustomGist" />
```

### Hide Line Numbers

```jsx
<Gist id="5555251" hideLineNumbers={true} />
```

### Show Only Specific Lines

```jsx
<Gist id="5555251" startLine={10} endLine={20} />
```

## Multiple Gists in One File

You can embed multiple Gists in the same document:

```jsx
import Gist from 'react-gist';

# My Documentation

Here's the main function:

<Gist id="5555251" />

And here's the configuration:

<Gist id="1234567" file="config.json" />
```

## Styling Gists

### Using CSS Classes

```css
.myCustomGist {
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  margin: 20px 0;
}

.myCustomGist .gist-meta {
  background-color: #f6f8fa;
  border-top: 1px solid #e1e4e8;
}
```

### Responsive Design

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .gist {
    font-size: 12px;
  }
  
  .gist .gist-file {
    margin: 10px 0;
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Gists Updated**: Since Gists are live, ensure your code examples stay current
2. **Use Descriptive Names**: Name your Gist files clearly for better organization
3. **Include Comments**: Add helpful comments in your Gist code
4. **Test Responsiveness**: Ensure Gists display well on mobile devices
5. **Consider File Size**: Very large Gists may impact page load times

## Troubleshooting

### Gist Not Loading
- Check that the Gist ID is correct
- Ensure the Gist is public (or you have proper access)
- Verify your internet connection

### Styling Issues
- Check for CSS conflicts with your theme
- Ensure custom styles have proper specificity
- Test in different browsers

### Performance
- Consider lazy loading for multiple Gists
- Monitor page load times with embedded Gists

## Alternative: Inline Code

For simple code snippets, consider using Docusaurus's built-in code blocks instead:

````markdown
```javascript
function example() {
  console.log('Hello, World!');
}
```
````

- Initiatives vs Priorities
	- **Initiatives:** Things I **want** to do
		- *What do I want to do?*
	-  **Priorities:** Things I **need** to do **now**
		- *What do I need to do now?*
- Initiatives vs Projects
	- Initiatives encode goals I have for myself ...
		- It seems like to use the term initiative more than project since it has an element of goal setting to it ..
	- Initiatives are high-level efforts that you will complete in order to achieve each goal.

#  Ideas vs Initiatives

description: 'Understanding the relationship between initiatives and ideas, and how initiatives generate recurring sets of new ideas.'

# Initiatives Vs Ideas
Initiatives ... will generate a recuring set of new ideas to enhance the initiative ...
An initiative ... is almost a desire to build something new ... in which building it is an idea itself ....
And as we dive deeper into the initiative ... we recursively develop new ideas ...

# Regarding initiatives ...
We will have actionable ideas ... that we can act on now ...
And future ideas ... regarding things we can eventually do ...


- What is stopping me from acting on each of the ideas ?

- Ideas vs Initiatives vs Priorities
	- I have a board of ideas ... that I can do
	- I have initiatives that I had engaged with ...
	- I have priorities that I am working on now ...
	- Where do projects fit into this?

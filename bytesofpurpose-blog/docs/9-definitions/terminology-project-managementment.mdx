What does it mean to plan ? 
How is it different than organizing?

# 🏛️ Planning vs Managing vs Organizing vs Distilling

The act of planning involves figuring out what to do / putting together a plan of action ... 
But that is in essence what I am trying to do across my different habits ... 
Thus I shouldn't have a planning folder ... but rather link to the "planning" oriented activities across the different buckets ...


With regards to priorities ... does one manage them ... plan them? Organize them ?

> **Planning is about determining all of the tasks that you need to complete in order to achieve your goals**.
I am not just planning ... thus one would't "plan" priorities ... one needs to manage them ...

Same thing with habits ... I do need to plan what each habit involves ... but when I have a bunch of rabbits fighting for the same time, I need to manage them ... 


# Do all of these plans revolve around managing time?



# ------------------

When it comes to task management ... what does a plan mean?

# 🏛️ Plans

* Planning to do something eventually ...
	* And carving out an initiative are different things ...
* Saying I plan to do x is one thing ...
	* Planning what to do to realize x is another (initiative)

Plans revolve around initiatives ...
Some plans repeat YoY. Other plans are adhoc ...

* This folder contains various plans 
* Some plans are in folders, others are not ..

* [ ] Add doc type as a field to every noteplan doc ...
	* [ ] There are plan docs ...
	* [ ] There structure docs - i.e readme describing folder 
		* [ ] doctype: 🏛️
* [ ] Add status emojis to every doc as well ... in title ... what does each mean .. 
	* [ ] 
Add some sort of age emoji to the title summary ... 


# 🗑️ Unorganized Plans
* These go at the root of the plan folder  ...

- Initiatives vs Priorities
	- **Initiatives:** Things I **want** to do
		- *What do I want to do?*
	-  **Priorities:** Things I **need** to do **now**
		- *What do I need to do now?*
- Initiatives vs Projects
	- Initiatives encode goals I have for myself ...
		- It seems like to use the term initiative more than project since it has an element of goal setting to it ..
	- Initiatives are high-level efforts that you will complete in order to achieve each goal.

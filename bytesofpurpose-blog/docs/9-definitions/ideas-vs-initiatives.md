# Initiatives Vs Ideas
Initiatives ... will generate a recuring set of new ideas to enhance the initiative ...
An initiative ... is almost a desire to build something new ... in which building it is an idea itself ....
And as we dive deeper into the initiative ... we recursively develop new ideas ...

# Regarding initiatives ...
We will have actionable ideas ... that we can act on now ...
And future ideas ... regarding things we can eventually do ...



- What is stopping me from acting on each of the ideas ?

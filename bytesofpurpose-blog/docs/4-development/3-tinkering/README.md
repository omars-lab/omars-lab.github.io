# Tinkering

Exploratory, informal experiments focused on hands-on learning and discovery through trial and error.

## What Is Tinkering?

Tinkering represents **exploratory, informal experimentation**:

- 🔍 Exploratory and curiosity-driven
- 🎓 Learning-focused through hands-on experience
- 🛠️ Informal testing and trial-and-error
- 💡 Discovery of new approaches and techniques
- 📚 Building understanding through practice

## Difference from Experiments

**Tinkering** vs **Experiments**:

- **Tinkering** → Exploratory, learning-focused, informal testing
- **Experiments** → Structured, hypothesis-driven, data-validated testing

Tinkering is about exploration and learning, while experiments follow scientific methodology with hypotheses, controls, and statistical validation.

## What You'll Find Here

- Hands-on exploration of tools and technologies
- Learning through trial and error
- Informal testing and discovery
- Building understanding through practice
- Exploratory work that may lead to more structured experiments
- "My first" hello world examples for different technologies

# Initiatives

Initiatives are ideas that have been researched, planned, and are ready to get started. They have blueprints, designs, and proper execution structure, but are not yet active projects.

## What Are Initiatives?

Initiatives represent the **getting started** phase of development:

- ✅ Have blueprints and designs in place
- ✅ Have proper execution structure defined
- ✅ Are ready to be executed
- ⏸️ Not yet active projects (not currently being worked on)

## Development Progression

Understanding how ideas evolve through the development lifecycle:

1. **Ideas** → Initial thoughts and concepts
2. **Research** → Deep dives and investigation
3. **POCs** → Proof of concepts to validate approaches
4. **Experiments** → Small, focused experiments for learning
5. **Initiatives** → Ready to get started (blueprints, designs, execution plan)
6. **Projects** → Actively being worked on

## From Initiative to Project

Once an initiative is prioritized and work begins, it becomes a **project**:

- Initiatives have blueprints/designs but aren't being actively developed
- Projects are initiatives that are now in active development
- Projects are more flushed out with ongoing work, implementation details, and progress tracking

## What You'll Find Here

- Initiatives with blueprints and designs
- Tools and apps ready for development
- Execution plans and structure
- Design documents and diagrams
- Roadmaps for implementation

# Projects

Projects are initiatives that have been prioritized and are now in **active development**. These are things being actively worked on, not just planned.

## What Are Projects?

Projects represent **active work** in progress:

- 🔨 Currently being developed
- 📊 Have ongoing implementation and progress tracking
- 📝 More flushed out with detailed implementation details
- 🎯 Have blueprints/designs and are executing on them
- ✅ Include tools, apps, and other development work

## From Initiative to Project

The progression from planning to execution:

1. **Initiative** → Has blueprint/design, ready to get started (not yet active)
2. **Project** → Initiative that's now being actively worked on

When an initiative is prioritized and development begins, it becomes a project.

## What You'll Find Here

- Active development work
- Implementation details and progress
- Tools and apps being built
- Backend and frontend projects
- Ongoing work with regular updates

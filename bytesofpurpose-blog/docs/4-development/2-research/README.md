# Research

Research is the second step in the development lifecycle. After having ideas, research helps you understand what you need to know before deciding whether to act on an idea, hold it, or discard it.

## What Is Research?

Research is **systematic investigation** to inform decision-making about ideas:

- 🔍 **Investigation** - Deep dives into technical topics, technologies, and approaches
- 📊 **Information Gathering** - Collecting data, examples, and best practices
- 🎯 **Decision Support** - Research should help you make informed decisions
- 📋 **Planning Foundation** - Research helps you create actionable plans

## Development Progression

Understanding how ideas evolve through the development lifecycle:

1. **Ideas** → Initial thoughts and concepts
2. **Research** → Investigation and planning (you are here)
3. **POCs** → Proof of concepts to validate approaches
4. **Experiments** → Small, focused experiments for learning
5. **Initiatives** → Ready to get started (blueprints, designs, execution plan)
6. **Projects** → Actively being worked on

## Research Outcomes

At the end of research, you should be able to make a decision:

- ✅ **Act on the idea** → Move to POC, experiment, or initiative
- ⏸️ **Hold the idea** → Not ready yet, needs more information or different timing
- ❌ **Discard the idea** → Not viable, not aligned with goals, or superseded

Research should help you **put a plan together** for the next steps.

## What Must I Research?

To act on an idea, you typically need to research:

### 1. Technical Feasibility
- **What technologies are needed?** - Identify required tools, frameworks, languages
- **What are the technical constraints?** - Performance, scalability, compatibility
- **What are the implementation approaches?** - Different ways to solve the problem
- **What are the trade-offs?** - Pros and cons of different technical choices

### 2. Existing Solutions
- **What already exists?** - Similar products, tools, or solutions
- **What are the gaps?** - What's missing or could be improved
- **What can I learn from others?** - Best practices, patterns, lessons learned
- **What are the alternatives?** - Different approaches or solutions

### 3. Requirements & Scope
- **What problem am I solving?** - Clear problem definition
- **Who is the target audience?** - Users, stakeholders, customers
- **What are the success criteria?** - How will I know it's successful?
- **What is the scope?** - What's in scope vs. out of scope

### 4. Resources & Constraints
- **What resources do I need?** - Time, money, tools, skills, infrastructure
- **What are my constraints?** - Budget, timeline, technical limitations
- **What skills do I need to learn?** - Knowledge gaps to fill
- **What dependencies exist?** - External factors, prerequisites

### 5. Market & Context
- **What is the market landscape?** - Competition, trends, opportunities
- **What is the timing?** - Is now the right time?
- **What are the risks?** - Technical, market, execution risks
- **What is the potential impact?** - Value, benefits, outcomes

## Research Plan Structure

A good research plan should answer:

### Research Questions
- What specific questions do I need answered?
- What information gaps exist?
- What assumptions need validation?

### Research Methods
- **Documentation Review** - Read official docs, tutorials, guides
- **Code Analysis** - Review existing implementations, examples
- **Community Research** - Forums, discussions, case studies
- **Prototyping** - Quick experiments to test assumptions
- **Expert Consultation** - Talk to people with experience

### Research Scope
- **Timeframe** - How long will research take?
- **Depth** - How deep should I go?
- **Breadth** - How many areas to cover?
- **Priorities** - What's most critical to research first?

### Research Deliverables
- **Findings Summary** - Key insights and learnings
- **Decision Framework** - Criteria for making decisions
- **Recommendations** - Suggested next steps
- **Action Plan** - What to do based on research

## Research Checklist

When researching an idea, ensure you:

- [ ] **Define research questions** - What do I need to know?
- [ ] **Identify information sources** - Where will I find answers?
- [ ] **Set research scope** - How deep and broad should research be?
- [ ] **Document findings** - Capture key insights and learnings
- [ ] **Evaluate options** - Compare different approaches
- [ ] **Assess feasibility** - Is this technically and practically viable?
- [ ] **Identify risks** - What could go wrong?
- [ ] **Make a decision** - Act, hold, or discard?
- [ ] **Create next steps** - What's the plan based on research?

## Research → Next Steps

After completing research, you should have enough information to:

1. **Move to POC** - If you need to validate a specific approach
2. **Start an Experiment** - If you need to test assumptions
3. **Create an Initiative** - If you have enough information to plan execution
4. **Hold the Idea** - If more information or better timing is needed
5. **Discard the Idea** - If research shows it's not viable

## What You'll Find Here

- Research investigations into technical topics
- Deep dives into technologies and approaches
- Research findings and learnings
- Decision frameworks based on research
- Research plans and methodologies
- **Learning Topics** - Learning goals, plans, and resources for various technologies and concepts (backend, frontend, business, software)

**Remember**: Research is not about perfection—it's about gathering enough information to make an informed decision about whether and how to proceed with an idea.

Alternative name - coach ...

plant - 
the genai tool that helps you grow your ideas ...
idea to initiatives to priorities to roadmap
I will have plan-less ideas initially... then ideas with a plan ... then planed ideas woth a work log ... then a roadmap for the evolution of the idea 


* [ ] plans vs roadmaps ... plans are how ypu intend to execute a non-started idea ... not all ideas have a plan ...
* [ ] roadmaps are how you will grow a started idea .

* [ ] AI has a big rile to play as a coach ...
	* [ ] It helps you find missing action items ... suggest improvements ... identify new areas worth discovering/ call out your blinders ...
	* [ ] I should make a noteplan on steroids... helps me mkve sections ... helps me relate new sectiona that tie to existing habits ...i.e auto complete hashtag when I make a section ...

# Differentiating
- Right now ... I don't have a separate diagramming / documentation habit ... does blogging effectively mix the two?


# Blogging
* [ ] Move my processes from blog to paper ...
	* [ ] My ideation habbit is a whole process ... I can conver it into a olanning doc ... 
	* [ ] how many other habits are whole processes too?
* [ ] what are the root most topics in my blog?
	* [ ] Software development, personal development, business development, process development? Spiritual Development? ... 
* [ ] I need to find a better way to deal with images ... svg??? smaller in size?? especially of I make them in figma??
	* [ ] Doesn't seem like I can export figjam to svg ... maybe only figma ...

# ----------
# Blog
* [ ] incorporate svg into blog, test with puml

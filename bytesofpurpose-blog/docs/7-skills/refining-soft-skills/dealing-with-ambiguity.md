# Dealing with Ambiguity

Practical approaches for navigating unclear goals, evolving customer needs, and uncertain situations. This is a core skill for senior+ roles, especially in Applied AI where requirements shift fast and the tech landscape evolves rapidly.

## Understanding Ambiguity

Ambiguity usually comes from:
- **Unclear goals** - Unclear objectives or success criteria
- **Evolving customer needs** - Changing requirements and expectations
- **Immature technology** - New technologies with uncertain capabilities

The key is to **not freeze** in ambiguous situations—instead, clarify what is known and start from there.

## Core Approach

### 1. Recognize the Ambiguity Early

Identify ambiguity quickly and acknowledge what you don't know.

**Example**: "We weren't sure whether customers wanted natural language prompts or pre-built templates, so I scoped a lightweight experiment to test both."

### 2. Anchor to Outcomes, Not Solutions

Focus on business/user value rather than technical purity.

**Key Questions:**
- What problem are we solving?
- What metric matters here?

**Example**: "Rather than debate LLM architectures, we focused on reducing the time it took a user to create their first automation from 20 minutes to under 5."

### 3. Use Iteration to Reduce Uncertainty

Build small, testable prototypes and use data to guide decisions.

**Approach:**
- Run experiments as soon as possible
- Use metrics, customer feedback, or A/B testing
- Let data inform next steps
- Dive deep into results and iterate

**Example**: "I shipped a rough prototype to 50 beta users in under 2 weeks, then pivoted based on their usage patterns."

### 4. Collaborate & Re-align Constantly

Partner with PMs, designers, and other engineers to reframe scope as needs shift.

**Communication:**
- Communicate tradeoffs clearly
- Show humility and flexibility
- Don't be married to a single solution

**Example**: "If we go with option A, we deliver faster but risk scaling issues. If B, we're slower but future-proof."

### 5. Adapt Through Continuous Learning

Be explicit about lessons learned from pivots and changes.

**Example**: "Initially we over-invested in fine-tuning, but customer adoption lagged. I learned to validate product-market fit before scaling model work."

## Real-World Examples

### Search Customer Experience

**Problem**: People were abandoning their search requests on amazon.com for fashion products. How to solve it was not clear—we didn't have clear goals.

**Approach**: Ran multiple experiments that taught us:
- How people perceive ads
- The impact of placing a search widget at the top/middle/bottom of a page
- The impact of getting the images right on a widget

**Outcome**: Data-driven insights informed the solution approach.

## Interview Framework

**Sample Answer Structure:**

"In applied AI, ambiguity is the default. One example was when we were building an LLM-powered feature, but we weren't sure which workflow would resonate with customers. Instead of debating internally, I proposed a lightweight prototype to validate assumptions quickly.

I worked with PM to define success as improving task completion time. We launched two small variants to a pilot group, measured usage, and collected direct customer feedback. When results showed customers wanted structured templates more than free-form prompting, we pivoted.

The outcome was a production-ready feature that reduced onboarding friction by 40%. More importantly, the process taught me how to reduce risk by running small experiments early, and how to stay aligned with product even as requirements changed."

## Key Principles

- **Ground things in the customer** - Let customer data and behavior influence decisions
- **Use POCs/experiments** - Have them inform next steps
- **Be outcome-focused** - Focus on what matters to users and business
- **Do the best with what you have and evolve** - Start with what's known and iterate

## Questions

- Do I need to individually track each of my habits?
- What data should I track for each habit?
- How do I build effective habit trackers and systems?
- What documentation guides do I need for habit development?
- Where do I document tasks vs plans vs initiatives?

## Decision

Building habits is essential for creating sustainable, long-term behavioral change. By systematically creating habit building processes, establishing proper documentation, and setting up tracking systems, I can ensure that new habits are effectively implemented and maintained. This meta-habit enables me to transform intentions into consistent actions through structured habit-building approaches.

## Strategy

I strategically approach building habits by:
- Creating habit boards and visual tracking systems
- Building comprehensive documentation guides for habit creation
- Establishing clear processes for tracking individual habits and their data
- Integrating immediate work (NotePlan) with planned work (VSCode)
- Creating systems that support both habit building and maintenance

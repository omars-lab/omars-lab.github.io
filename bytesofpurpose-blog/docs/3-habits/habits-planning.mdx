## Questions

- What are my ongoing initiatives and how do they relate to goals, habits, and initiatives?
- How do I harness the energy from root initiatives that fraction into sub-initiatives?
- Are my short-term goals still valid?
- Are my long-term goals still valid?
- Where do plans start and where do they end?
- What fits in paper vs NotePlan vs other tools?
- How can I simplify my vision board?

## Decision

Planning is essential for creating structure, direction, and clarity in achieving goals and realizing visions. It involves systematically setting goals, developing visions, capturing plans, and creating visual representations of aspirations. This habit is crucial for transforming abstract ideas into concrete action plans, ensuring that efforts are aligned with overarching objectives, and maintaining focus on what truly matters. It enables the transformation of dreams into achievable realities through structured thinking and organized execution.

## Strategy

I strategically approach planning by:
- Setting clear, revisitable goals (both short-term and long-term)
- Developing and maintaining vision boards to visualize aspirations
- Capturing ongoing initiatives and understanding their relationships to goals and habits
- Creating systematic flows for plan development and execution
- Consolidating decisions and plans in organized repositories
- Simplifying complex vision boards to maintain clarity and focus

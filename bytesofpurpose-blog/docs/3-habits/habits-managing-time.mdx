## Questions

- How much time should I be spending per habit?
- Do I have enough time for all my activities?
- How do I use my time effectively?
- What are all the different things I constantly do?
- What will we do with our time?
- What actions have we prioritized?
- What do I need to constantly do?
- How am I freeing up time to do these on a regular basis?

## Decision

Managing time is essential for creating structure and ensuring that important activities receive adequate attention. By organizing daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly activities, tracking progress, and developing systems for time allocation, I can ensure that my priorities are met consistently. This habit enables me to transform time intentions into structured, organized practices that support my goals and maintain balance across all areas of life.

## Strategy

I strategically approach managing time by:
- Organizing activities by frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- Tracking progress on time-based activities
- Classifying activities as regular or constant needs
- Developing systems for time allocation and habit tracking
- Creating structure for consistent execution of priorities

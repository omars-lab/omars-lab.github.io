## Questions

- How often am I reading?
- What books should I prioritize reading?
- How can I make reading a consistent daily habit?
- What types of content should I focus on for growth?

## Decision

Reading is essential for continuous learning, personal growth, and staying current with knowledge and ideas. It involves developing consistent reading habits, exploring diverse content, and applying insights to improve skills and understanding. This habit is crucial for professional development, expanding perspectives, and maintaining intellectual curiosity. It transforms passive consumption into active learning and knowledge application.

## Strategy

I strategically approach reading by:
- Establishing daily reading goals and consistent reading habits
- Prioritizing books that enhance professional skills (e.g., Agile, Clean Code)
- Balancing different types of content for comprehensive growth
- Creating systems to track reading progress and apply insights
- Making reading a regular, integrated part of daily routines

## Figma Diagram Section

- [ ] Add Figma diagram link >2025-01-31

## Questions

- What software do I want to develop?
- What am I working on developing?
- What are the kinds of software I develop?
- What tools do I want to develop?
- Why do I develop?
- What are all the different reasons I develop?
- What do I desire?
- What can I do to improve my productivity?
- What are all the different tech projects I want to work on?

## Decision

Developing software is essential for creating standalone software that I can be proud to publish to others. By consistently working on tech projects, I can improve my productivity, build valuable tools, and create meaningful software solutions. This habit enables me to transform ideas into tangible software products that serve real purposes and can be shared with others.

## Strategy

I strategically approach developing software by:
- Always working on tech projects to maintain momentum
- Focusing on standalone software that I can be proud to publish
- Developing different kinds of software including blog enhancements, iOS applications, and GenAI projects
- Creating tools that improve productivity and serve real purposes
- Building software that can be shared and published to others

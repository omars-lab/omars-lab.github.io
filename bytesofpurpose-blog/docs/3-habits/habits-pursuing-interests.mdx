## Questions

- Why is all my thinking in a CNC ... I am not a wood maker ... I am a programmer ...?
- Do I really want the larger CNC machine?
- Will I really have a workshop?
- How can I use Google Pose Kit to track prayer?
- How can I make a prayer buddy?

## Decision

Pursuing interests is essential for personal fulfillment, creative expression, and maintaining a balanced life beyond professional obligations. It involves exploring hobbies, developing new skills, and engaging in activities that bring joy and satisfaction. This habit is crucial for preventing burnout, fostering creativity, and maintaining a sense of identity beyond work. It transforms abstract interests into concrete projects and experiences that enrich life and provide meaningful outlets for personal growth and expression.

## Strategy

I strategically approach pursuing interests by:
- Exploring diverse hobbies and creative outlets (CNC machines, Islamic art, programming projects)
- Balancing technical interests with creative and spiritual pursuits
- Using programming skills to enhance traditional hobbies and create innovative solutions
- Developing projects that combine multiple interests (e.g., prayer detection using pose recognition)
- Considering practical constraints (workshop space, time, resources) when pursuing new interests

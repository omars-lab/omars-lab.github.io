## Questions

- How do I capture and organize my ideas effectively?
- What's the difference between ideas, initiatives, and priorities?
- Where do projects fit into my ideation process?
- How do my different goals interlace and connect?
- What artifacts should I create to support my ideation process?

## Decision

Ideation is essential for capturing thoughts, organizing concepts, and developing a systematic approach to idea management. Visual ideation boards and artifact development help transform abstract thoughts into concrete, actionable plans. This habit enables better decision-making, goal alignment, and personal growth by providing structured ways to capture, organize, and develop ideas.

## Strategy

I strategically approach ideation by:
- Using visual boards in Figma to capture and organize different types of content
- Distinguishing between ideas, initiatives, and priorities
- Creating motivational and vision boards to support goal achievement
- Developing experiment pipelines to test and validate concepts
- Capturing artifacts that support ongoing ideation and development

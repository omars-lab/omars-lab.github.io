## Decision

Reviewing is essential for maintaining progress, ensuring accountability, and making informed decisions about future actions. It involves conducting regular reviews at different time intervals (weekly, monthly, annual), tracking progress toward goals, and establishing systematic processes for reflection and improvement. This habit is crucial for staying focused, identifying areas for growth, and ensuring that efforts are aligned with overarching objectives. It transforms scattered activities into structured progress tracking and continuous improvement.

## Strategy

I strategically approach reviewing by:
- Establishing regular review cycles (weekly, monthly, annual)
- Tracking key metrics and progress indicators
- Identifying delayed, debated, and potential actions
- Creating systematic processes for goal review and accountability
- Measuring spiritual and personal development metrics
- Balancing different types of content consumption and activities

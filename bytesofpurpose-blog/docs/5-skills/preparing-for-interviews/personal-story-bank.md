# Personal Story Bank for Leadership Interviews

A comprehensive collection of personal experiences structured using the STAR method to demonstrate leadership principles in interviews.

## Purpose

This story bank was created to address three critical preparation needs:

- **I need to have ready-to-use stories**: Pre-structured STAR method responses for common leadership questions
- **I need to demonstrate leadership principles**: Each story showcases specific leadership qualities with concrete examples
- **I need to avoid common pitfalls**: Focus on individual ownership, specific metrics, and quantifiable results

The goal is to transform personal experiences into compelling, structured stories that demonstrate leadership capabilities through concrete examples and measurable outcomes.

<summary>ðŸ“– Story: Redshift Cluster Cost Optimization - $2.5M Annual Savings (Click to expand)</summary>

- **Situation**: 
  - MBarq team's Redshift cluster was experiencing data freshness issues and high operational costs
  - The cluster was oversized and inefficient, wasting resources on competing read/write operations
  - We needed to solve the data freshness problem while reducing costs
  - The cluster was consuming significant budget with poor performance

- **Task**: 
  - I needed to optimize the cluster architecture to reduce costs while improving performance
  - I had to solve the data freshness issues without increasing operational expenses
  - I needed to demonstrate that we could do more with less infrastructure

- **Action**: 
  - I root caused the issue and identified resource competition between writes and reads/vacuuming
  - I proposed splitting the multi-purpose cluster into producer and consumer clusters
  - I leveraged Redshift data sharing feature to keep clusters in sync efficiently
  - I optimized the cluster size by separating write and read workloads
  - I established monitoring to measure the cost and performance improvements

- **Result**: 
  - Reduced total Redshift cluster size by 36%, contributing to $2.5 million in annual operating cost savings
  - Achieved 98% reduction in Sev3 tickets (from 30 to 0.5 tickets per month)
  - Improved cluster freshness SLA from 90% to 99.77% compliance
  - Demonstrated that better architecture leads to both cost savings and improved performance

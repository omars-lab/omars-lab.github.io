# Personal Story Bank for Leadership Interviews

A comprehensive collection of personal experiences structured using the STAR method to demonstrate leadership principles in interviews.

## Purpose

This story bank was created to address three critical preparation needs:

- **I need to have ready-to-use stories**: Pre-structured STAR method responses for common leadership questions
- **I need to demonstrate leadership principles**: Each story showcases specific leadership qualities with concrete examples
- **I need to avoid common pitfalls**: Focus on individual ownership, specific metrics, and quantifiable results

The goal is to transform personal experiences into compelling, structured stories that demonstrate leadership capabilities through concrete examples and measurable outcomes.

<details>
<summary>ðŸ“– Story: Buy Button Customer Experience Gap (Click to expand)</summary>

- **Situation**: 
  - I was implementing backend logic for buy button clicks on Cicada experiences (DP, SED, Gallery)
  - Upon inspecting Figma designs, I noticed there were no experiences dedicated for buy button errors
  - Customers would be redirected to generic "500"/ops page with no specialized feedback about what went wrong
  - This created a frustrating experience when customers raced to purchase collections but inventory depleted

- **Task**: 
  - I needed to identify and address this customer experience gap before launch
  - I had to work with Product and UX to surface appropriate error messages to customers
  - I needed to ensure customers received clear feedback about purchase issues

- **Action**: 
  - I consulted both Product and UX regarding the need to surface additional buy button errors
  - I mapped out 5 specific scenarios where surfacing errors in PSP would be problematic
  - I pushed for addressing these issues prior to launch and worked with Sr. PM and UX engineer
  - I led implementation of backend components while SDE I worked on frontend experience
  - I ensured Buy button API redirects to pages associated with individual error scenarios

- **Result**: 
  - We successfully implemented dedicated error pages for 5 specific buy button error scenarios
  - The collaborative effort to improve CX was appreciated by the Cicada UX team
  - Customers now receive clear, actionable feedback instead of generic error pages
  - This prevented customer frustration during high-demand collection drops

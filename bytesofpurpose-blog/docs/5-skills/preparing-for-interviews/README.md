# Complete Interview Preparation Guide

A systematic approach to preparing for technical and behavioral interviews using proven frameworks and personal story banks.

## Purpose

This guide was created to address four critical preparation needs:

- **I need to understand what interviewers expect**: Learn the specific skills, behaviors, and competencies that companies evaluate
- **I need to prepare compelling stories**: Develop a comprehensive bank of STAR-method stories that demonstrate leadership principles
- **I need to master technical problem-solving**: Practice structured approaches to coding challenges and system design questions
- **I need to ask the right questions**: Prepare thoughtful questions that demonstrate genuine interest and help evaluate fit

The goal is to transform interview anxiety into confidence through systematic preparation and practice.

## Why Interview Preparation Matters

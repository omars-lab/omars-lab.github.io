# Understanding Technical Skills: What Companies Actually Evaluate

A comprehensive guide to the technical skills companies evaluate in interviews, including specific concerns, strengths, and progression expectations for different SDE levels.

## Purpose

This guide was created to address three critical needs:

- **I need to understand what companies actually evaluate**: Learn the specific technical skills and behaviors that determine interview success
- **I need to prepare effectively for technical interviews**: Focus on the most impactful behaviors and avoid common pitfalls
- **I need to demonstrate technical competence**: Showcase the right combination of skills that companies value most

The goal is to transform technical interview preparation from guesswork into a systematic, evidence-based approach.

## Why Technical Skills Matter

Companies evaluate technical skills to ensure candidates can:

- **Deliver Quality Code**: Write maintainable, efficient, and scalable solutions
- **Solve Complex Problems**: Break down ambiguous problems into actionable solutions
- **Design Systems**: Create architectures that can scale and evolve
- **Make Sound Decisions**: Choose appropriate technologies and approaches
- **Handle Ambiguity**: Work effectively when requirements are unclear
- **Influence Stakeholders**: Communicate technical concepts to non-technical audiences

## How Companies Evaluate Technical Skills

Companies look for evidence that candidates can:

1. **Write Quality Code**: Clean, maintainable, and efficient solutions
2. **Solve Complex Problems**: Break down problems systematically with optimal approaches
3. **Design Scalable Systems**: Create architectures that can evolve and scale
4. **Design Efficient Databases**: Create data models that optimize performance and usability
5. **Apply Data Structures & Algorithms**: Use optimal approaches to solve computational problems

## Preparing for Technical Interviews

### **Story Preparation Framework**

For each technical skill area, prepare stories that demonstrate:

- **Context**: What was the situation and why was it challenging?
- **Action**: What specific technical decisions did you make?
- **Result**: What was the outcome and what did you learn?
- **Tradeoffs**: What alternatives did you consider and why did you choose your approach?

### **Key Success Factors**

- **Ask Clarifying Questions**: Always understand the problem before solving it
- **Explain Your Thinking**: Walk through your decision-making process
- **Consider Tradeoffs**: Discuss pros and cons of different approaches
- **Handle Edge Cases**: Think about error conditions and boundary cases
- **Communicate Clearly**: Adapt your explanation to your audience's technical level

## Action Items

This section contains specific action items that readers can take to enhance their understanding or apply the concepts from this post:

- [ ] **Audit Your Technical Skills**: Review each of the 5 technical skill areas and identify 2-3 concerning behaviors you currently exhibit, then create a plan to develop the corresponding strength behaviors
- [ ] **Prepare Story Bank**: For each technical skill area, prepare 2-3 specific examples that demonstrate strength behaviors, using the Context-Action-Result framework with clear tradeoff discussions
- [ ] **Practice Technical Communication**: Record yourself explaining a technical decision you made, focusing on how you considered alternatives, evaluated tradeoffs, and communicated your reasoning to different audiences
- [ ] **Mock Interview Preparation**: Conduct practice sessions where you work through technical problems while explicitly demonstrating the strength behaviors from each skill area, especially asking clarifying questions and explaining your thought process

**Implementation Notes:**
- Each action item should be specific and measurable with clear deliverables
- Focus on the most impactful behaviors first (top rows in each table)
- Include expected outcomes: improved interview performance, clearer technical communication, better problem-solving approach
- Consider different skill levels: beginners should focus on basic functionality, intermediate on optimization, advanced on system design and stakeholder management
- Provide context: these behaviors directly correlate with interview success and job performance

## Conclusion

Technical skills evaluation goes beyond coding ability—it assesses how you approach problems, make decisions, and communicate technical concepts. By understanding what companies look for and preparing stories that demonstrate these competencies, you can showcase your technical expertise effectively in interviews.

Remember: Companies want to see not just what you can build, but how you think, adapt, and collaborate to solve real-world technical challenges.

I've been using GenAI tools for over a year. Here's my practical workflow.

<!-- truncate -->

# My GenAI Workflow

## Core Tools

**Development**: Claude + GitHub Copilot + Cursor AI
**Writing**: Claude for brainstorming, structure, and editing
**Research**: Claude + Perplexity for synthesis

## My Setup

### MCP Server
Custom Model Context Protocol server with:
- File operations
- Code analysis  
- Project management
- Knowledge synthesis

### Prompt Library
25+ productivity prompts for:
- **Code**: API development, testing, documentation
- **Writing**: Blog structure, technical docs, emails
- **Problem-solving**: Architecture review, debugging, research

## Personal GenAI Prompt Catalog

## Impact

**Speed**: 3x faster development, 4x faster research
**Quality**: 40% fewer bugs, more consistent patterns
**Time**: More focus on strategy vs. implementation

## Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering
- Be specific with context and requirements
- Provide examples of desired output
- Iterate and refine based on results

### Quality Control
- Always review AI output
- Test generated code
- Maintain your authentic voice

### Integration
- Start with simple tasks
- Customize for your workflow
- Measure actual impact

## Key Tools

- **Claude**: Complex reasoning and writing
- **GitHub Copilot**: Code completion
- **Cursor AI**: Advanced code editing
- **Perplexity**: Research synthesis

## What Works

- Specific prompts with clear context
- Iterative refinement approach
- Human oversight and validation
- Custom integration for your needs

## What Doesn't

- Generic, vague prompts
- Blind trust in AI output
- One-size-fits-all approaches
- Set-and-forget mentality

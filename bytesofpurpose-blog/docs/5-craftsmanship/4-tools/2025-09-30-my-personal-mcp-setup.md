# My Personal MCP Setup

I want to talk about how I built my own MCP and I configured it in cursoer ... how I use it ...
How I use it for prompt management, etc ...

## Overview

My MCP server provides a standardized interface between AI models and my development tools, enabling seamless automation and enhanced productivity.

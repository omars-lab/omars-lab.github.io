# Coding Challenges and Algorithm Solutions

Master algorithm problem-solving with our comprehensive collection of coding challenges, solutions, and problem-solving techniques.

## Problem-Solving Techniques

Build your algorithmic thinking skills with these fundamental approaches:

- **[Bitwise Operations](/docs/interviewing/coding-challenges/problem-solving-techniques/bitwise-ops)** - Master bit manipulation for efficient solutions
- **[Cycle Detection](/docs/interviewing/coding-challenges/problem-solving-techniques/cycle-detection)** - Detect cycles in linked lists and graphs
- **[Look Ahead](/docs/interviewing/coding-challenges/problem-solving-techniques/look-ahead)** - Anticipate future states in problem solving
- **[Path Traversal](/docs/interviewing/coding-challenges/problem-solving-techniques/path-traversal)** - Navigate through trees and graphs effectively
- **[Subsets](/docs/interviewing/coding-challenges/problem-solving-techniques/subsets)** - Generate and work with subset combinations

## Algorithm Solutions

Detailed solutions to classic coding problems:

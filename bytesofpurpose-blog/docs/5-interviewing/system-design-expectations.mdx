# System Design Interview Expectations

This guide consolidates the key questions and decision points that interviewers evaluate during system design discussions. Use these as a framework to ensure you cover all critical aspects.

## Database Selection & Data Modeling

### Database Choice Questions
- **What database type fits your use case?** (SQL vs NoSQL vs specialized)
- **Do you need ACID compliance?** What level of consistency is required?
- **What are your transaction requirements?** Do you need distributed transactions?
- **How will you handle data partitioning?** Can your data be easily sharded?
- **What are your read vs write patterns?** (Read-heavy, write-heavy, balanced)
- **What's your data growth rate?** How will the database scale over time?

### Data Model Design Questions
- **What are your primary access patterns?** How will users query the data?
- **How often does your data structure change?** Do you need schema flexibility?
- **Is your data structured, semi-structured, or unstructured?**
- **What relationships exist between entities?** How will you model them?
- **What are your indexing requirements?** Which fields need fast lookups?

## System Architecture & Scalability

### Scaling Decisions
- **How will you handle horizontal vs vertical scaling?**
- **What's your partitioning strategy?** How will you distribute data?
- **How will you handle load balancing?** What's your traffic distribution approach?
- **What's your caching strategy?** Where and what should you cache?
- **How will you handle database connections?** Connection pooling strategy?

### Performance & Latency
- **What are your latency requirements?** P50, P95, P99 targets?
- **Where are your bottlenecks likely to be?** How will you identify and address them?
- **What's your throughput requirement?** Requests per second?
- **How will you handle peak vs average load?** What's your capacity planning?

## Data Flow & Communication

### Data Movement Patterns
- **Push vs Pull architecture?** When does each make sense?
- **Do you need real-time vs batch processing?**
- **What's your event-driven architecture strategy?**
- **How will you handle data consistency across services?**
- **What's your message queue strategy?** (Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.)

### API Design Questions
- **What's your API design philosophy?** REST, GraphQL, gRPC?
- **How will you handle API versioning?**
- **What's your rate limiting strategy?**
- **How will you handle authentication and authorization?**
- **What's your error handling and retry strategy?**

## Reliability & Fault Tolerance

### Availability & Redundancy
- **What's your availability target?** (99.9%, 99.99%, etc.)
- **How will you handle single points of failure?**
- **What's your disaster recovery strategy?**
- **How will you handle data backup and recovery?**
- **What's your circuit breaker strategy?**

### Monitoring & Observability

- **What's your A/B testing strategy?**

## Security & Compliance

### Security Considerations

- **What existing systems can you integrate with?**
- **How will you handle third-party dependencies?**
- **What's your API gateway strategy?**
- **How will you handle service discovery?**

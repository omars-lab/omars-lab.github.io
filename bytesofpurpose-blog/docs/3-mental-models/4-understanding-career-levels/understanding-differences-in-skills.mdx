# Understanding Software Engineer Levels

## Purpose

This guide was created to address four critical needs:

- **I need to understand the different SDE levels**: Learn the progression from Junior to Principal Engineer and what distinguishes each level
- **I need to know the roles and responsibilities of each level**: Get a clear breakdown of expectations and scope for each engineering level
- **I need to understand the competency requirements**: See detailed skill expectations and how they differ across levels
- **I need to plan my career progression**: Understand the timeline and requirements for advancing between levels

The goal is to transform confusion about engineering levels into clarity through structured competency mapping and interactive skill visualization.

## Why This Content Matters

Understanding these engineering levels helps in several ways:

- **Career Planning**: Engineers can identify areas for growth and set realistic goals
- **Hiring**: Managers can better assess candidates and set appropriate expectations
- **Team Building**: Teams can understand complementary skills and knowledge gaps
- **Performance Reviews**: Clear criteria for evaluation and promotion decisions

The progression from L4 to L7 represents not just increased technical skill, but also growing responsibility for business impact, team development, and organizational influence.

## Engineer Levels Overview

```yaml
# AI METADATA - DO NOT REMOVE OR MODIFY
# AI_UPDATE_INSTRUCTIONS:
# This blog post is tightly coupled with the SdeSkill component and requires
# careful synchronization to maintain functionality and accuracy.
#
# 1. SCAN_SOURCES: Monitor /src/components/SdeSkill.jsx for skill definition changes
# 2. EXTRACT_DATA: Extract skill codes, descriptions, and mappings from SdeSkill component
# 3. UPDATE_CONTENT: Update skill links, descriptions, table references, and rubrics to match component
# 4. VERIFY_CHANGES: Test that all skill links navigate correctly and table displays properly
# 5. MAINTAIN_FORMAT: Preserve the interactive skill components and search anchor format
#
# CONTENT_PATTERNS:
# - Skill Links: [SKILL_CODE]: #skill-anchor:~:text=%3E%20Skill%20Name format
# - Interactive Components: <SdeSkill role="SDE" skill="CODE" l="LEVEL"/> format
# - Purpose Section: Must use "I need to..." format for each bullet point
# - Skills Section: Should contain key questions that address what each skill measures
# - Interview Questions: Use format "* *Interview Questions:*" with indented sub-bullets
# - Experience Information: Include typical experience ranges and progression context
# - Rubrics Section: Tabbed comparisons must reflect current skill expectations from component
#
# DATA_SOURCES:
# - Primary: /src/components/SdeSkill.jsx (skill definitions and mappings)
# - Secondary: This document (skill descriptions, questions, and rubrics)
#
# UPDATE_TRIGGERS:
# - SdeSkill.jsx component changes (skill additions, modifications, removals)
# - Skill code changes in the component
# - New competency areas or level requirements
# - Changes to skill progression or level expectations
# - Modifications to skill descriptions that affect level differentiators
#
# FORMATTING_RULES:
# - Maintain exact skill code matching between table and component
# - Preserve text search anchors for skill navigation
# - Keep theme groupings consistent (Problem Solving, Technical, etc.)
# - Ensure all skill links use proper markdown link format
# - Maintain collapsible AI metadata section format
# - Interview questions must use consistent bullet formatting with indented sub-bullets
# - Experience information should be included in Engineer Levels Overview section
# - All interview questions should be behavioral and level-appropriate
# - Rubrics must accurately reflect skill expectations from SdeSkill component
# - Tabbed rubrics should use Docusaurus Tabs/TabItem components with proper imports
#
# RUBRIC_UPDATE_REQUIREMENTS:
# - When skill descriptions change in SdeSkill.jsx, update corresponding rubric comparisons
# - Ensure rubric tables reflect current skill expectations for each level
# - Update behavioral indicators when skill progression changes
# - Maintain consistency between main skill table and rubric differentiators
# - Verify that interview questions in rubrics align with skill expectations
# - Keep tab labels descriptive and consistent with level terminology
#
# LINK_ACCURACY_REQUIREMENTS:
# - Verify all skill link references match exact section titles
# - Check that [CODE]: #anchor:~:text=%3E%20Section%20Title format matches actual section headers
# - Ensure highlighting links work by testing navigation from table to sections
# - When adding new skills, create matching link references with correct text encoding
# - URL encode special characters in section titles (e.g., & becomes %26, / becomes %2F)
# - Verify that all skill codes in table have corresponding link references at bottom
# - Test that clicking skill names in table properly highlights and navigates to sections
#
# VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST:
# - [ ] All skill codes in component exist in blog post table
# - [ ] All skill codes in blog post table exist in component
# - [ ] All skill links navigate correctly and highlight properly
# - [ ] Interview questions are level-appropriate and behavioral
# - [ ] AI metadata reflects current skill dependencies
# - [ ] Link reference text matches exact section titles (case-sensitive)
# - [ ] Special characters in section titles are properly URL encoded
# - [ ] All skills have complete sections with interview questions
#
# UPDATE_FREQUENCY: Check monthly or when SdeSkill component is modified

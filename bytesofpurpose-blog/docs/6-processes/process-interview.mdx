# The Complete Technical Interview Process: From Application to Offer

A comprehensive guide to understanding the technical interview process from both candidate and company perspectives, including preparation, execution, and decision-making.

## Purpose

This guide was created to address three critical needs:

- **I need to understand the complete interview process**: Learn what happens from application submission to final decision, including behind-the-scenes activities
- **I need to prepare effectively for each stage**: Know what to expect at each phase and how to position myself for success
- **I need to handle outcomes professionally**: Understand how decisions are made and how to respond to different results

The goal is to demystify the technical interview process and help you navigate it with confidence and strategic awareness.

## The Interview Process Overview

The technical interview process is a multi-stage journey that involves both visible activities (what you experience) and behind-the-scenes activities (what companies do internally). Understanding both perspectives is crucial for success.

# Priorities
  - I need to cat markdowns with links
  
* [ ] Make a tool to cat a markdown with links to stdout with terminal links
* Make a command line tool to cat markdown!

- Should I turn this into a blog?

- Make a Markdown to Terminal Color tool!
    - Add ability to consider html tags to color coded terminal output!

- If I work on the md to terminal script – and parse markdown … can use it to ignore text and categorize links under different headings!

- [ ] Scratch this ... https://github.com/sharkdp/bat already kinda does this ...

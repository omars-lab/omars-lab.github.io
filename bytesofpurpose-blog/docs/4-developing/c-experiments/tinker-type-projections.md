# Experiment: Projecting Types

All types start out as primitives .... 
And from the primitives we build ...
Look at fibbounacis sequence ...
from 0 and 1, we can get 1, then from 1 and 1 we get 2, from 2 and 1 we get 3 ...

Types start out as something primitive ... 
What if we as humans are the same!

Type projections ... projecting a type as another type ...
can we make cortex a type system ...
a type based operating system ... 
One that is sensitive to real types ...
    One that knows how to compute types?
    One that knows how to generate instances of a certain type?
    One that is based off of existence?
    One that can logically be distributed?
    What can I do on my own with implicits ...
    Encoding values into types ....
        Powerful stuff!

If you have a whole bunch of these things ... and any thingy can be projected as this other type ... and we can un project back into a thingy ...
can we define type based operations ... where ETL has a type signature!
@end Build a type projection system!

# Pitfalls

What should I avoid doing?

# Avoid Doing
- Don’t try to over abstract the methods for hexagons and apply them to all polygons ...
	- We might have northeast, west … for hexagons … not the same for Nonangos …
- I need to not diverge and try to make a d3 shapes library … and instead … focus on the actual patterns …

# [#Developing] Apple Watch Prayer Metrics App

- [ ] Ask ChatGPT how to do this ...

Unfortunately, as a language model, I am not able to create apple watch apps. However, I can provide you with some information on how to create one that detects if a user is standing.
To detect if a user is standing, you can use the Core Motion framework in iOS. This framework provides access to the accelerometer, gyroscope, and other sensors in the device. By using the accelerometer data, you can determine the user's posture and whether they are standing or not.
Here are the general steps you would need to take to create an app that detects if a user is standing:
	1	Create a new Xcode project for an iOS app and select the "Single View App" template.
	2	In the "ViewController.swift" file, import the CoreMotion framework.
	3	Create an instance of CMMotionManager and start the accelerometer updates using the startAccelerometerUpdates() method.
	4	In the callback for the accelerometer updates, check the acceleration data for the z-axis. If the value is close to -1, the user is likely standing.
	5	Use an if statement to check the z-axis value and update the UI to indicate whether the user is standing or not.
	6	Create a storyboard and add a label to show the status of user.
It's important to note that this is a basic example, and you'll likely need to implement more advanced logic and error handling to make the app more accurate and reliable.
Also, you'll need to have knowledge of Swift and iOS development and have an Apple developer account to submit the app to App Store.

# Priorities
  - I need a easy way to take note of concents and relationships
  
- Make a dep graph tool
- I should have a standardized way of defining concepts ... say and extenstion cipher ...
- I should be able to derive a graph based on this!
- Can piggy back off of plantuml mind maps for now ..

- Should be able to summarize markdown files too ...

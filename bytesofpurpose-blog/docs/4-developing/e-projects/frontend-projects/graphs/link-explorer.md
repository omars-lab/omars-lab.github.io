# [#Analyzing] Links

- [ ] Autogenerating mindnode file ...
	- [ ] Complex ... need coordiantes ...
	- [ ] mindnode files are zips with files in the `Apple binary property list` format
		- [ ] âžœ  testexports file /Users/omareid/Desktop/testexports/contents.xml
		- [ ] /Users/omareid/Desktop/testexports/contents.xml: Apple binary property list
		- [ ] https://medium.com/@karaiskc/understanding-apples-binary-property-list-format-281e6da00dbd
	- [ ] With mind node ... we can't run interesting queries on the links ...

# Idea: Links in Neo4j

* Using raw networks?
	* https://ericmjl.github.io/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple/01-introduction/02-networkx-intro/

* Analyzing with neo4j?
	* https://neo4j.com/developer/desktop-csv-import/
	* https://neo4j.com/docs/
	* https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-cheat-sheet/5/auradb-enterprise/

- [ ] Continue [[[#Analyzing] Links]]
	- [ ] Turn links into cypher ...
	- [ ] Have cypher queries to analyze links!
	- [ ] figure queries ..
		- [ ] which files are not linked to ...
		- [ ] circular refs?
		- [ ] can I mark a file as an initiative file and do special analysis on them?
		- [ ] Top 10 files with outgoing links
		- [ ] top 10 with incomming links ...

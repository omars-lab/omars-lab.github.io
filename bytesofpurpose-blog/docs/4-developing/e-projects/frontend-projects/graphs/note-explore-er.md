# Priorities

- [ ] I need a consistent way to fuzzy search iA-writer from terminal … and auto complete tags!

- [ ] I can make an index of my IA writer files in Mind-node …
	- [ ] Turn the iA-writer links into a mind node diagram? Or plant uml …
		- [ ] Consider # blocks … as subsections … 
	- [ ] Maybe even link to specific sections!

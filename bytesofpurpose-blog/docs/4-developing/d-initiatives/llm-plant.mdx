plant - 
the genai tool that helps you grow your ideas ...
idea to initiatives to priorities to roadmap
I will have plan-less ideas initially... then ideas with a plan ... then planed ideas woth a work log ... then a roadmap for the evolution of the idea 


* [ ] plans vs roadmaps ... plans are how ypu intend to execute a non-started idea ... not all ideas have a plan ...
* [ ] roadmaps are how you will grow a started idea .

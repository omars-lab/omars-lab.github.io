# Understanding Zapier's Cultural Values: A Deep Dive into Remote-First Culture

Zapier has built one of the most successful remote-first companies in the tech industry, serving millions of users with their automation platform. Their success isn't just about their product—it's deeply rooted in their cultural values that guide how they work, make decisions, and serve their customers.

Based on their [Culture and Values page](https://zapier.com/jobs/culture-and-values-at-zapier), Zapier has five core values that have evolved over their 10+ year journey. Let's explore what each value means and what we can learn from their approach.

## The Five Core Values

### 1. Default to Action

**Core Principle:** "Delivering something real today—and learning from it—is typically better than delivering something of questionably better quality next week."

This value emphasizes the importance of moving quickly and learning through doing. However, it's not about reckless action—it's about taking action that connects to clear priorities and outcomes, especially what's best for their mission and customers.

**Key Insights:**
- Action should be connected to clear priorities and outcomes
- Make decisions based on reasonably available information
- Prioritize ideas with the biggest upside
- Consider diverse end-user needs when taking action

### 2. Default to Transparency

**Core Principle:** "We do our best work when we make projects, processes, and systems available to everyone who needs them—inclusive of our customers."

For a distributed team across more than a dozen time zones, transparency is essential. It promotes equity and inclusion within their team and customer base. The key is working in public, having discussions in the open, and documenting work.

**Key Insights:**
- Transparency promotes equity and inclusion
- Work in public and document your work
- Be clear about who is responsible for decisions
- Use transparency to encourage high standards of excellence

### 3. Grow Through Feedback

**Core Principle:** "Feedback enables growth. Whether it's about how we work or the work itself, feedback is one of Zapier's most essential practices."

This value recognizes that success has more to do with how quickly you learn than how "perfect" you are in a given moment. Feedback is essential for growth, even though it can be hard to give and receive.

**Key Insights:**
- Seek feedback from a diverse range of people
- Engage with feedback from anyone, regardless of their level
- Provide feedback directly and compassionately
- Use feedback to deepen understanding, even when you disagree

### 4. Empathy Over Ego

**Core Principle:** "To serve our customers and teams best, we need to understand them. Empathy promotes understanding, curiosity, and humility."

This value emphasizes the importance of understanding customers and teammates as part of a global community. While ego can bias thinking toward our own views, empathy helps connect with and serve others.

**Key Insights:**
- Work with others to generate great ideas
- Take interest in teammates' and customers' well-being
- Adapt plans based on new information
- Take responsibility for the impact of words and actions

### 5. Build the Robot

**Core Principle:** "Find ways to work better—whether through automation, simplification, or prioritization—so that we can spend more time doing what humans do best."

This value is about finding ways to eliminate repetitive work through automation, simplification, or prioritization. However, it's important to automate the right processes and outcomes.

**Key Insights:**
- Find tools, processes, or code to help grow efficiently
- Figure out what needs to be automated through experimentation
- Optimize for efficiency after testing the underlying process
- Learn about customers' and teammates' needs to inform solutions

## What Makes These Values Effective

### 1. **Specificity with Examples**
Each value includes detailed examples of what to do and what not to do. This removes ambiguity and provides clear guidance for team members.

### 2. **Customer and Team Focus**
Every value connects back to either customer impact or team collaboration. This ensures that values aren't just internal—they drive external results.

### 3. **Practical Application**
The values aren't abstract concepts. They provide concrete behaviors and decision-making frameworks that can be applied in daily work.

### 4. **Evolution and Refresh**
Zapier explicitly states that their values have evolved over time. They reviewed and refreshed them in 2022, showing that values should be living documents that adapt to the organization's growth.

## Lessons for Other Organizations

### For Remote Teams
- **Transparency is crucial** for distributed teams to function effectively
- **Default to action** helps overcome the paralysis that can come with remote work
- **Empathy over ego** becomes even more important when you can't rely on in-person cues

### For Customer-Focused Companies
- **Feedback loops** are essential for understanding customer needs
- **Transparency with customers** builds trust and momentum
- **Automation** should serve customer needs, not just internal efficiency

### For Growing Organizations
- **Clear decision-making processes** become more important as teams grow
- **Documentation and transparency** help maintain culture across distributed teams
- **Values should evolve** with the organization's maturity and challenges

## The Zapier Way: A Model for Modern Organizations

Zapier's values represent a modern approach to organizational culture that's particularly well-suited for:

- **Remote-first companies** that need to maintain culture across distance
- **Customer-focused organizations** that prioritize user experience
- **Growing companies** that need scalable cultural practices
- **Tech companies** that value both innovation and execution

Their emphasis on action, transparency, feedback, empathy, and automation creates a culture that's both human-centered and efficiency-focused—a combination that's essential for modern organizations.

## How Zapier Compares to Tech Giants

To understand Zapier's unique approach, let's compare it with two tech giants: Amazon and Meta.

### **Amazon's Leadership Principles (16 principles)**
Amazon's approach is comprehensive and performance-driven, designed for massive scale with principles like "Customer Obsession," "Bias for Action," and "Insist on the Highest Standards."

### **Meta's Culture (6 core values)**
Meta's [culture](https://www.metacareers.com/culture) focuses on connection and innovation with values like "Move Fast," "Build Awesome Things," and "Live in the Future."

## The Three-Company Comparison

| Aspect | Zapier | Amazon | Meta |
|--------|--------|--------|------|
| **Values Count** | 5 focused | 16 comprehensive | 6 core |
| **Tone** | Collaborative, empathetic | Performance-driven | Innovation-focused |

| **Remote Work** | Explicitly designed for | Implicitly adaptable | In-person focused |
| **Company Size** | Mid-size (hundreds) | Massive (millions) | Large (tens of thousands) |
| **Key Strength** | Transparency & Feedback | Scale & Standards | Innovation & Connection |

### **What Makes Zapier Unique**

**Zapier's Sweet Spot:**
- **Perfect for mid-size companies** (100-1,000 employees)
- **Remote-first by design** with transparency and empathy
- **Balanced approach** between human needs and business results
- **Learning-oriented** with continuous feedback loops

**When to Choose Each Approach:**

## Conclusion

Zapier's values represent a modern approach to organizational culture that's particularly well-suited for mid-size, remote-first companies. Their emphasis on transparency, empathy, and continuous learning creates a culture that balances human needs with business results.

The key insight is that effective values should be:

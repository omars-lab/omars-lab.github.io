Yes — and this is a really sharp question, because once you’re interviewing at the staff level, companies are evaluating you less on whether you can build things and more on whether you can multiply impact across people, systems, and strategy.

Here are the key traits most companies (including Zapier) look for in Staff Engineers, broken down into buckets:

1. Technical Excellence & Judgment

System design mastery → you can simplify and architect for scale without over-engineering.

Technical judgment → you know when to ship scrappy vs. when to harden.

Managing complexity (as we covered) → modular abstractions, reducing future drag.

Broad tech literacy → you may not be the deepest in every area, but you’re credible across stacks (infra, product, AI/ML).

⚡ What they listen for: “This engineer consistently makes the right technical tradeoffs and raises the team’s bar for engineering decisions.”

2. Product & Customer Orientation

Translate business goals into technical solutions.

Understand customer needs deeply and prioritize simplicity in the experience.

Don’t just build features → ensure they deliver measurable outcomes (adoption, retention, satisfaction).

Push back gracefully when product wants everything at once — by framing tradeoffs in terms of impact, not just effort.

⚡ What they listen for: “They think like a product owner, not just an engineer.”

3. Leadership Without Authority

You may not manage people, but you influence widely:

Mentorship & technical guidance.

Driving alignment across PMs/design/other teams.

Building consensus around hard tradeoffs.

You raise the floor: proactively reduce tech debt, build reusable patterns, improve processes.

⚡ What they listen for: “Teams get better when this engineer is in the room — they unblock, align, and elevate others.”

4. Navigating Ambiguity

Able to turn fuzzy goals (“make AI more useful”) into concrete projects.

Use iteration & experimentation to reduce uncertainty.

Keep stakeholders aligned even as goals shift.

⚡ What they listen for: “They thrive when things are unclear and help others find clarity.”

5. Strategic Thinking

See the bigger picture: how today’s choices impact next year’s roadmap.

Can align technical direction with company strategy (e.g., in applied AI, balancing rapid LLM advances with stability).

Have opinions on where technology is going, but grounded in delivering business/customer value now.

⚡ What they listen for: “They think not just about the next feature, but the trajectory of the platform.”

6. Communication

Clear, concise storytelling — technical and non-technical audiences.

Document decisions and tradeoffs in a way others can follow.
`
Calm under pressure → they de-escalate instead of inflaming disagreements.

⚡ What they listen for: “I’d trust them to explain this project to executives or to onboard a new engineer.”

7. Owning Outcomes

Not just shipping code, but owning results: adoption, usage, reliability, cost efficiency.

Measure success, learn from failures, iterate.

Willing to take accountability when things don’t land, and extract lessons for the org.

⚡ What they listen for: “They hold themselves to outcomes, not just output.”

✅ If you put it all together, the Staff Engineer archetype is:

A highly credible technologist who raises the level of the team, makes strong judgment calls, thrives in ambiguity, and drives projects from concept to customer impact — not just through code, but through influence and clarity.

Omar — would you like me to make a checklist / scorecard of these traits (like what interviewers are silently grading you against)? That way, you’d have a one-pager to prep with and sanity-check your stories against before the interview.

Perfect — here’s a Staff Engineer Interview Scorecard / Checklist you can use as a prep tool. Think of this like the rubric hiring managers will use (explicitly or implicitly). You can use it to sanity-check your stories and answers.

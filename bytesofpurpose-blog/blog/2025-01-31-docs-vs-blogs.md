I needed to distinguish when I should create a new blog post vs doc; thus I made this post.

# Docs vs Blog Posts: When to Choose Each Format

As a developer creating content, one of the most important decisions you'll make is whether your new content should be a blog post or documentation. Understanding the differences between these formats will help you create more effective content and better serve your audience.

## The Core Difference

**Documentation** is designed for reference and durability. It's the content people return to when they need to solve a specific problem or understand how something works.

**Blog posts** are designed for discovery and storytelling. They capture moments in time, share experiences, and help people learn through narrative.

## When to Choose Documentation

### ✅ Choose docs when your content is:

- **Reference material**: Step-by-step guides, API documentation, configuration instructions
- **Durable knowledge**: Information that won't become outdated quickly
- **Problem-solving focused**: "How to do X" content that solves specific problems
- **Comprehensive**: Complete guides that cover a topic thoroughly
- **Searchable**: Content people will look for when they have a specific need

### Examples of good documentation:
- "Setting up a local development environment"
- "Docusaurus configuration guide"
- "Algorithm problem-solving techniques"
- "React component patterns"

## When to Choose Blog Posts

### ✅ Choose blog posts when your content is:

- **Time-sensitive**: Current events, new tool releases, or trending topics
- **Personal experience**: Your journey learning something, mistakes made, lessons learned
- **Opinion or analysis**: Your take on industry trends or tool comparisons
- **Story-driven**: Content that benefits from narrative structure
- **Discovery-focused**: Content that helps people find new ideas or approaches

### Examples of good blog posts:
- "My experience migrating from X to Y"
- "Why I switched to this new framework"
- "Lessons learned from building my first SaaS"
- "Comparing different approaches to solve problem Z"

## The Tinkering Timeline Approach

One powerful way to think about blog posts is as a **tinkering timeline**. Blog posts excel at capturing:

- **The journey**: What you tried, what failed, what worked
- **The context**: Why you made certain decisions at the time
- **The evolution**: How your understanding changed over time
- **The human element**: Frustrations, breakthroughs, and insights

This approach makes your content more relatable and valuable to readers who are on similar journeys.

## Content Strategy Framework

Here's a simple framework to help you decide:

### Ask yourself:
1. **Will this content be useful in 2 years?** → Documentation
2. **Does this capture a specific moment or experience?** → Blog post
3. **Are people likely to search for this exact information?** → Documentation
4. **Does this benefit from storytelling or personal perspective?** → Blog post
5. **Is this a complete, authoritative guide?** → Documentation
6. **Is this about my process or journey?** → Blog post

## Hybrid Approach: The Best of Both Worlds

Sometimes the best strategy is to use both formats:

1. **Write a blog post** about your experience and lessons learned
2. **Create documentation** with the technical details and step-by-step instructions
3. **Link between them** so readers can choose their preferred format

This approach maximizes the reach and usefulness of your content.

## Key Principles for Each Format

### Documentation Principles:
- Be comprehensive and accurate
- Use clear, scannable formatting
- Include code examples and practical steps
- Make it easy to find specific information
- Keep it updated and maintained

### Blog Post Principles:
- Tell a story with a clear beginning, middle, and end
- Share personal insights and experiences
- Use engaging headlines and introductions
- Include your thought process and decision-making
- Make it relatable and human

## Conclusion

The choice between documentation and blog posts isn't always clear-cut, but understanding their different purposes will help you create more effective content. 

**Remember**: Good documentation helps people solve problems. Good blog posts help people discover new ideas and learn from your experiences.

Choose the format that best serves your content's purpose and your audience's needs. And don't be afraid to experiment—sometimes the best content comes from trying a format you're less comfortable with.

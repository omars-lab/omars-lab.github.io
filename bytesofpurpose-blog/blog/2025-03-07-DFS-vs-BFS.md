# What is the difference in the questions?
How do you know DFS is the optimal solution for a graph problem bs BFS?


BFS useful to compare two different trees: 
    https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=breadth-first-search
    https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=breadth-first-search
BFS useful to group tree nodes by level
    https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=breadth-first-search
BFS useful for "level order traversal"\
    https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal-ii/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=breadth-first-search
    
Both can be used to find the number of levels in a tree

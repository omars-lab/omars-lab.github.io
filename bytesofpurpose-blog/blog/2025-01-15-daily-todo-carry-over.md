# Daily Todo Carry Over: Automating Task Management with AI

> 📁 **View the actual prompt**: [Daily Todo Carry Over Prompt](https://github.com/omars-lab/prompts/tree/main/organize/carry-over-daily-todos.md)

## High-Level Intent & Value Proposition

The Daily Todo Carry Over prompt automates the tedious process of managing incomplete tasks across multiple daily note files. Instead of manually reviewing and moving unfinished work, this AI-powered solution processes the last 2 weeks of daily notes, extracts meeting notes into organized files, and intelligently schedules incomplete tasks to appropriate future dates.

**Estimated Annual Time Savings: 26-35 hours per year**
- **Weekly Processing**: 15-20 minutes saved per week vs manual task management
- **Annual Total**: 780-1,040 minutes (13-17 hours) in direct time savings
- **Additional Benefits**: 13-18 hours saved through reduced mental overhead, improved focus, and eliminated task duplication
- **ROI**: For a knowledge worker earning $75/hour, this represents $1,950-$2,625 in annual value

## The Problem It Solves

### 🚨 Task Overflow
Incomplete tasks scattered across multiple daily note files create cognitive load and make it difficult to maintain focus on current priorities.

### 📝 Meeting Note Chaos  
Meeting notes mixed with daily tasks make it hard to find important information and action items.

### ⏰ Manual Overhead
Manually reviewing and moving tasks is time-consuming and error-prone, leading to lost tasks and duplicated effort.

### 🔗 Context Loss
Without proper organization, the context and relationships between tasks get lost over time.

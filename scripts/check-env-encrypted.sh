# check-env-encrypted.sh — no plaintext secret may enter this repo's history.
#
# This repo commits an ENCRYPTED sidecar of its .env. That is deliberate
# (dotenvx: every value is `encrypted:BB…`, decryptable only with the private key
# in .env.keys, which is never committed) and it is what lets a second machine
# bootstrap from one LastPass entry instead of hand-copying every secret.
#
# The plaintext .env itself stays gitignored — but .gitignore now carries
# `!.env.encrypted` / `!.env.*.encrypted` exceptions so the sidecar CAN be
# committed, and .gitignore cannot tell an encrypted sidecar from a plaintext
# file that happens to be named `.env.encrypted` (a botched `dotenvx decrypt`, an
# editor "save as", a half-finished rotation). One such file is a `git add` away
# from committing every credential in it. This can tell them apart, and it is the
# reason those un-ignore exceptions were allowed in.
#
# Usage:
#   check-env-encrypted.sh --staged   # what is about to be committed (hook)
#   check-env-encrypted.sh            # what is tracked right now (make / CI)
#
# Exit 0 clean / 1 a violation or an unreadable line / 2 misuse. Needs no
# secrets, no network, and not even dotenvx — it reads shape, not content.

# env-keys.sh — move .env.keys between this machine and LastPass.
#
# .env.keys holds the dotenvx PRIVATE key. It is the one file that is never
# committed and never backed up anywhere but the vault: with it, every value in
# the committed .env.encrypted is readable; without it, none are.
#
# The vault entry is named after the repository — `dotenvx/<repo>` — because
# these sibling repos will not share a keypair. One entry per repo means a
# rotation in one cannot silently invalidate another, and the entry name tells
# you which checkout it belongs to without opening it.
#
# Usage:
#   env-keys.sh pull    LastPass -> .env.keys   (new machine; refuses to clobber)
#   env-keys.sh push    .env.keys -> LastPass   (after minting or rotating a key)
#   env-keys.sh status  is a key present here, in the vault, and do they match?
#
# The key value is never passed as a command-line argument (argv is world-
# readable via ps), never echoed, and never written to a temp file. It moves
# through a pipe or not at all. `status` compares fingerprints, not keys.

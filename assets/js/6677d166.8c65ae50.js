While this works, creating reusable React components would provide:\\n- Consistent styling and theming\\n- Easier reuse across multiple posts\\n- Better integration with Docusaurus theme (light/dark mode)\\n- Component-level documentation in Storybook\\n- Type safety and validation\\n\\n### Planned Components\\n\\n#### 1. MermaidDiagram Component\\n**Purpose**: Base component for rendering Mermaid diagrams\\n\\n**Features**:\\n- Accepts Mermaid code as prop or children\\n- Automatic theme detection (light/dark mode)\\n- Loading states\\n- Error handling with fallback display\\n- Responsive sizing\\n- Configurable Mermaid options\\n\\n**Props**:\\n```typescript\\ninterface MermaidDiagramProps {\\n  code: string;\\n  title?: string;\\n  config?: MermaidConfig;\\n  height?: string | number;\\n  theme?: \'light\' | \'dark\' | \'auto\';\\n  className?: string;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### 2. MermaidTimeline Component\\n**Purpose**: Specialized component for timeline diagrams\\n\\n**Features**:\\n- Pre-configured timeline styling\\n- Common timeline patterns\\n- Date formatting helpers\\n- Color scheme integration\\n\\n#### 3. MermaidFlowchart Component\\n**Purpose**: Specialized component for flowcharts and process diagrams\\n\\n**Features**:\\n- Pre-configured flowchart styling\\n- Common flowchart patterns\\n- Node styling helpers\\n- Link styling customization\\n\\n#### 4. MermaidSequence Component\\n**Purpose**: Specialized component for sequence diagrams\\n\\n**Features**:\\n- Pre-configured sequence diagram styling\\n- Actor styling helpers\\n- Message formatting\\n- Activation box styling\\n\\n#### 5. MermaidGantt Component\\n**Purpose**: Specialized component for Gantt charts\\n\\n**Features**:\\n- Pre-configured Gantt styling\\n- Date range helpers\\n- Task grouping\\n- Milestone markers\\n\\n### Implementation Strategy\\n\\n#### Phase 1: Base Component\\n1. Create `src/components/Mermaid/MermaidDiagram.tsx`\\n2. Integrate with `@docusaurus/theme-mermaid`\\n3. Add theme detection using `useColorMode` hook\\n4. Implement error boundaries\\n5. Add loading states\\n6. Create Storybook stories\\n\\n#### Phase 2: Specialized Components\\n1. Create specialized components (Timeline, Flowchart, Sequence, Gantt)\\n2. Add component-specific styling and helpers\\n3. Create Storybook stories for each\\n4. Document usage patterns\\n\\n#### Phase 3: Integration\\n1. Update documentation in `docs/6-techniques/3-blogging-techniques/2-embed-diagrams/`\\n2. Create usage examples\\n3. Migrate existing mermaid diagrams to use components (optional)\\n4. Add component to MDXComponents for global availability\\n\\n### Technical Considerations\\n\\n#### Dependencies\\n- `@docusaurus/theme-mermaid` - Already installed\\n- `mermaid` - Already installed\\n- `@docusaurus/theme-common` - For `useColorMode` hook\\n\\n#### Theme Integration\\n- Detect current theme using `useColorMode()` hook\\n- Pass theme to Mermaid config\\n- Support manual theme override\\n- Ensure proper contrast in both themes\\n\\n#### Performance\\n- Lazy load Mermaid library if needed\\n- Memoize diagram rendering\\n- Optimize re-renders on theme changes\\n\\n#### Error Handling\\n- Catch Mermaid parsing errors\\n- Display error message with original code\\n- Fallback to code block display\\n- Log errors for debugging\\n\\n### Storybook Integration\\n\\nCreate stories for:\\n- Base MermaidDiagram component\\n- Each specialized component\\n- Theme switching (light/dark)\\n- Error states\\n- Loading states\\n- Various diagram types\\n\\n### Documentation\\n\\nUpdate:\\n- `docs/6-techniques/3-blogging-techniques/2-embed-diagrams/diagrams-mermaid.mdx`\\n- Add component usage examples\\n- Document props and configuration\\n- Add migration guide from code fences\\n\\n### Benefits\\n\\n1. **Consistency**: All diagrams use same styling and theming\\n2. **Reusability**: Easy to reuse diagrams across posts\\n3. **Maintainability**: Centralized styling and configuration\\n4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript props prevent errors\\n5. **Documentation**: Storybook provides interactive examples\\n6. **Theme Support**: Automatic light/dark mode support\\n7. **Error Handling**: Better error messages and fallbacks\\n\\n## Execution Results / Attempts\\n\\n### \u2705 Initial Work Completed (2025-09-15 to 2025-09-29)\\n\\n**Work Period:** September 15, 2025 to September 29, 2025\\n\\n**Commits:** 2 commits related to Mermaid diagrams\\n\\n**Key Accomplishments:**\\n- Got Mermaid diagrams working in the blog\\n- Added comprehensive professional contributions timeline using Mermaid diagrams\\n\\n**Notable Commits:**\\n- `4402f778` (2025-09-15): Got mermaid diagrams to work\\n- `dc099fc3` (2025-09-29): feat: Add comprehensive professional contributions timeline and approach documentation\\n\\n**Status:** Initial Mermaid integration is complete. The blog now supports Mermaid diagrams. The plan to create reusable React components wrapping Mermaid diagrams is still planned for future work."},{"id":"/development/2025-XX-XX-component-enhancement-graph-component","metadata":{"permalink":"/changelog/development/2025-XX-XX-component-enhancement-graph-component","editUrl":"https://github.com/omars-lab/omars-lab.github.io/edit/master/bytesofpurpose-blog/changelog/changelog/development/2025-XX-XX-component-enhancement-graph-component.md","source":"@site/changelog/development/2025-XX-XX-component-enhancement-graph-component.md","title":"Blog Graph Component","description":"Establish a new graph component for blog content visualization and navigation","date":"2025-11-18T15:48:34.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.7,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Blog Graph Component","description":"Establish a new graph component for blog content visualization and navigation","status":"planned","inception_date":"2025-01-20","execution_date":"TBD","type":"feature","component":"Graph","priority":"medium"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Mermaid-Based Components for Blog","permalink":"/changelog/development/2025-XX-XX-component-creation-mermaid-diagrams"},"nextItem":{"title":"Component Development Roadmap","permalink":"/changelog/development/2025-XX-XX-documentation-component-development-roadmap"}},"content":"# Blogging Mechanisms - Graph Component \\n * [ ] I need to deal with name conflicts in graph highlighting\\n\\t* [ ] https://blog.bytesofpurpose.com/docs/techniques/blogging-techniques/embed-structural-components/graph#graph-node-2\\n* [ ] Mobile friendly graph \\n\\t* [ ] I need a mobile version of the graph rebderer when the panel is simpler amd under the graph ...\\n\\n\\n### Graph Renderer ...\\n* [ ] Make a graph based blog post on the genai ecosystem ...\\n\\t* [ ] Add links to nodes, fix titles, etc .\\n* [ ] Move it to separate react component repo? \\n* [ ] Make the graph renderer actually pop you a section that takes you to the markdown ... and in inverse link that takes you back to the graph ...\\n## Using Graph Renderer\\n* [ ] Move all the research over to be an individual blog post about the Agentic AI Domain ... \\n\\n\\n## Execution Plan\\n\\n## Execution Results / Attempts\\n\\n### Status: Not Started\\n\\nExecution has not yet begun.

Currently seeing warnings for large bundles (1.41 MiB for force-graph libraries)\\n2. **Improve initial load time** - Reduce time to first paint and interactive\\n3. **Better code splitting** - Ensure heavy libraries load only when needed\\n4. **Optimize caching** - Separate chunks for better browser caching\\n\\n### Areas to Optimize\\n\\n1. **Storybook Build**\\n   - Large bundles: `70.fd609f3c.iframe.bundle.js` (1.41 MiB), `878.38cfd5e5.iframe.bundle.js` (983 KiB)\\n   - Main entrypoint: 1.43 MiB combined\\n   - Force-graph libraries (`react-force-graph-2d`, `d3-force`) are heavy and should be code-split\\n\\n2. **Docusaurus Blog Build**\\n   - Optimize production bundle sizes\\n   - Ensure proper tree-shaking\\n   - Lazy load heavy components (Graph component)\\n\\n3. **Webpack Configuration**\\n   - Configure code splitting for better chunk separation\\n   - Optimize chunk sizes and caching strategies\\n   - Enable tree-shaking and dead code elimination\\n\\n## Execution Results / Attempts\\n\\n### \u2705 Initial Webpack Optimization (2025-01-20)\\n\\n**What We Tried:**\\n1. **Added webpack code splitting configuration** in `.storybook/main.ts`:\\n   - Configured `splitChunks` to separate large libraries into their own chunks\\n   - Created separate chunks for `force-graph` libraries (`react-force-graph-2d`, `d3-force`)\\n   - Separated Storybook addons into their own chunks\\n   - Set `usedExports: true` to enable tree-shaking\\n\\n2. **Chunk Separation Strategy:**\\n   ```typescript\\n   forceGraph: {\\n     name: \'force-graph\',\\n     test: /[\\\\\\\\/]node_modules[\\\\\\\\/](react-force-graph|force-graph|d3-)[\\\\\\\\/]/,\\n     chunks: \'all\',\\n     priority: 30,\\n     enforce: true,\\n   }\\n   ```\\n\\n**Results:**\\n- \u2705 Code splitting configuration added successfully\\n- \u2705 Force-graph libraries are now in separate chunks\\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Bundle size warnings still present (expected - these are large libraries)\\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Main entrypoint still shows 1.43 MiB (includes runtime + main bundle)\\n\\n**What Worked:**\\n- Webpack configuration successfully merged with Storybook\'s existing optimization settings\\n- Chunk separation is working - force-graph libraries are isolated\\n- Configuration is non-breaking and merges safely with Storybook defaults\\n\\n**What Didn\'t Work / Limitations:**\\n- Bundle size warnings persist because:\\n  - `react-force-graph-2d` and `d3-force` are inherently large libraries (~1.4 MiB)\\n  - Storybook itself bundles many development dependencies\\n  - These are dev tools, so absolute bundle size is less critical than production\\n- The warnings are informational - Storybook is primarily a development tool\\n\\n**Current Status:**\\n- Code splitting is configured and working\\n- Large libraries are properly isolated into separate chunks\\n- Bundle size warnings remain but are expected for heavy libraries\\n- Further optimization would require:\\n  - Lazy loading stories that use heavy components\\n  - Removing unused Storybook addons\\n  - Considering alternative lighter libraries (if available)\\n\\n### Next Steps\\n\\n1. **Lazy Load Heavy Stories**\\n   - Only load Graph stories when they\'re actually viewed\\n   - Use React.lazy() or dynamic imports for Graph component stories\\n\\n2. **Review Storybook Addons**\\n   - Audit which addons are actually used\\n   - Remove unused addons (`@storybook/addon-interactions`, `@storybook/addon-links` if not needed)\\n\\n3. **Docusaurus Production Optimization**\\n   - Apply similar code splitting strategies to Docusaurus build\\n   - Ensure Graph component is lazy-loaded in production\\n   - Optimize CSS bundle sizes\\n\\n4. **Monitor and Measure**\\n   - Track bundle sizes over time\\n   - Measure actual load times (not just bundle sizes)\\n   - Use Lighthouse/WebPageTest for real-world performance metrics\\n\\n## Related Links\\n\\n- [Storybook Webpack Config](../../.storybook/main.ts)\\n- [Graph Component](../../src/components/Graph/GraphRenderer.tsx)\\n- [Performance Optimization Entry](../2025-XX-XX-infrastructure-improvement-performance.md)"},{"id":"/development/2025-XX-XX-plan-leveraging-genai-enhance-blog","metadata":{"permalink":"/changelog/development/2025-XX-XX-plan-leveraging-genai-enhance-blog","editUrl":"https://github.com/omars-lab/omars-lab.github.io/edit/master/bytesofpurpose-blog/changelog/changelog/development/2025-XX-XX-plan-leveraging-genai-enhance-blog.md","source":"@site/changelog/development/2025-XX-XX-plan-leveraging-genai-enhance-blog.md","title":"Plan -

Imports: `GraphRenderer`, `NodeRendererDemo`\\n   - Usage: Component documentation and examples\\n   - Impact: **High** - Main component documentation\\n\\n2. **`docs/3-mental-models/6-understanding-the-genai-domain/2025-11-10-ai-framework-landscape.md`**\\n   - Imports: `AIFrameworkGraph`\\n   - Usage: Displays AI framework comparison graph\\n   - Impact: **High** - Live graph visualization\\n\\n**Blog Posts:**\\n1. **`blog/2025-03-07-DFS-vs-BFS.md`**\\n   - May reference graph concepts (needs verification)\\n   - Impact: **Low** - Likely just mentions, not imports\\n\\n2. **`blog/2025-09-27-my-contributions.mdx`**\\n   - May reference graph components (needs verification)\\n   - Impact: **Low** - Likely just mentions, not imports\\n\\n#### Import Path Updates Required\\n\\nWhen components move to subdirectories, import paths in MDX files need updates:\\n\\n**Before:**\\n```mdx\\nimport GraphRenderer from \'@site/src/components/Graph/GraphRenderer\';\\nimport NodeRendererDemo from \'@site/src/components/Graph/NodeRendererDemo\';\\nimport AIFrameworkGraph from \'@site/src/components/Graph/AIFrameworkGraph\';\\n```\\n\\n**After (if components move to subdirectories):**\\n```mdx\\n// Option 1: If index.tsx is created, no change needed\\nimport GraphRenderer from \'@site/src/components/Graph/GraphRenderer\';\\nimport NodeRendererDemo from \'@site/src/components/Graph/NodeRendererDemo\';\\nimport AIFrameworkGraph from \'@site/src/components/Graph/AIFrameworkGraph\';\\n\\n// Option 2: If explicit paths are preferred\\nimport GraphRenderer from \'@site/src/components/Graph/GraphRenderer/GraphRenderer\';\\nimport NodeRendererDemo from \'@site/src/components/Graph/NodeRendererDemo/NodeRendererDemo\';\\nimport AIFrameworkGraph from \'@site/src/components/Graph/AIFrameworkGraph/AIFrameworkGraph\';\\n```\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Use `index.tsx` files so imports don\'t need to change.\\n\\n#### Update Strategy for Blog Posts and Docs\\n\\n**Phase 0: Before Reorganization**\\n1. **Audit all imports**\\n   ```bash\\n   # Find all files importing Graph components\\n   grep -r \\"from \'@site/src/components/Graph\\" blog/ docs/\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Document current import paths**\\n   - List all files that import Graph components\\n   - Note which components are imported\\n   - Create checklist for updates\\n\\n**Phase 0: During Reorganization**\\n1. **Update import paths** (if needed)\\n   - If using `index.tsx`, imports may not need changes\\n   - If not using `index.tsx`, update all import paths\\n   - Test each file after updating\\n\\n2. **Verify components still work**\\n   - Build Docusaurus site: `make build`\\n   - Check each page that uses Graph components\\n   - Verify graphs render correctly\\n   - Test interactive features (clicking, zooming, etc.)\\n\\n**After Each Refactoring Phase**\\n1. **Test affected pages**\\n   - Rebuild Docusaurus: `make build`\\n   - Check pages that use Graph components\\n   - Verify no regressions\\n\\n2. **Update documentation if needed**\\n   - Update component documentation if APIs change\\n   - Update examples if usage patterns change\\n   - Update README files if structure changes\\n\\n#### Files to Update Checklist\\n\\n**Documentation:**\\n- [ ] `docs/6-techniques/3-blogging-techniques/1-embed-structural-components/graph.mdx`\\n  - [ ] Update `GraphRenderer` import if path changes\\n  - [ ] Update `NodeRendererDemo` import if path changes\\n  - [ ] Verify examples still work\\n  - [ ] Update documentation if component API changes\\n\\n- [ ] `docs/3-mental-models/6-understanding-the-genai-domain/2025-11-10-ai-framework-landscape.md`\\n  - [ ] Update `AIFrameworkGraph` import if path changes\\n  - [ ] Verify graph renders correctly\\n  - [ ] Test interactive features\\n\\n**Blog Posts:**\\n- [ ] `blog/2025-03-07-DFS-vs-BFS.md`\\n  - [ ] Check if it actually imports components (may just mention)\\n  - [ ] Update if needed\\n\\n- [ ] `blog/2025-09-27-my-contributions.mdx`\\n  - [ ] Check if it actually imports components (may just mention)\\n  - [ ] Update if needed\\n\\n**Other Documentation:**\\n- [ ] Check all files in `docs/` that mention \\"graph\\" or \\"Graph\\"\\n  - [ ] Update import paths if needed\\n  - [ ] Update examples if component API changes\\n  - [ ] Update code snippets if usage patterns change\\n\\n#### Testing Blog Posts and Docs\\n\\n**After Each Phase:**\\n1. **Build Docusaurus**\\n   ```bash\\n   cd bytesofpurpose-blog\\n   yarn build\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Check for Build Errors**\\n   - Look for import errors\\n   - Look for component not found errors\\n   - Fix any broken imports\\n\\n3. **Visual Verification**\\n   - Start dev server: `yarn start`\\n   - Navigate to each page that uses Graph components\\n   - Verify graphs render correctly\\n   - Test interactive features\\n\\n4. **Anchor Link Testing**\\n   - Test URL hash navigation (e.g., `#graph-node-123`)\\n   - Verify nodes/edges highlight correctly\\n   - Verify scrolling to graph works\\n\\n#### Backward Compatibility Strategy\\n\\n**Goal**: Ensure existing blog posts and docs continue to work without changes.\\n\\n**Strategy**:\\n1. **Use index.tsx files** - Allows imports to remain unchanged\\n2. **Maintain public API** - Don\'t change component props or behavior\\n3. **Re-export from root** - Consider re-exporting from `Graph/index.ts` for convenience\\n\\n**Example re-export file:**\\n```typescript\\n// src/components/Graph/index.ts\\n// Re-export all public components for convenience\\nexport { GraphRenderer } from \'./GraphRenderer\';\\nexport { AIFrameworkGraph } from \'./AIFrameworkGraph\';\\nexport { NodeRendererDemo } from \'./NodeRendererDemo\';\\nexport type { GraphRendererProps } from \'./GraphRenderer\';\\n```\\n\\nThis allows imports like:\\n```mdx\\nimport { GraphRenderer, AIFrameworkGraph } from \'@site/src/components/Graph\';\\n```\\n\\n#### Documentation Update Guidelines\\n\\n**When to Update Documentation:**\\n- \u2705 Component moves to subdirectory (update import paths)\\n- \u2705 Component API changes (update examples)\\n- \u2705 New features added (document new features)\\n- \u2705 Breaking changes (document migration path)\\n- \u274c Internal refactoring only (no doc updates needed if public API unchanged)\\n\\n**What to Update:**\\n1. **Import statements** - If paths change\\n2. **Code examples** - If API changes\\n3. **Usage patterns** - If best practices change\\n4. **Component documentation** - If features change\\n5. **README files** - If structure changes\\n\\n**What NOT to Update:**\\n- Internal implementation details (unless relevant to users)\\n- File structure (unless it affects imports)\\n- Utility functions (unless they\'re part of public API)\\n\\n### Storybook Story Updates\\n\\n#### Story Path Updates\\nWhen components move to subdirectories, Storybook story paths may need updates:\\n\\n**Before:**\\n```typescript\\n// GraphMenuBar.stories.tsx (at root)\\nimport { Meta } from \'@storybook/addon-docs/blocks\';\\n<Meta title=\\"Graph/GraphMenuBar\\" />\\n```\\n\\n**After:**\\n```typescript\\n// GraphMenuBar/GraphMenuBar.stories.tsx\\nimport { Meta } from \'@storybook/addon-docs/blocks\';\\n<Meta title=\\"Graph/GraphMenuBar\\" />\\n// Path stays the same - Storybook uses title, not file path\\n```\\n\\n#### Story Co-location Benefits\\n- Stories live next to components\\n- Easy to find component documentation\\n- Stories can import from `./ComponentName` (same directory)\\n- Better organization in Storybook sidebar\\n\\n#### Story Import Updates\\nWhen components move to subdirectories:\\n\\n**Before:**\\n```typescript\\n// GraphMenuBar.stories.tsx\\nimport { GraphMenuBar } from \'./GraphMenuBar\';\\n```\\n\\n**After:**\\n```typescript\\n// GraphMenuBar/GraphMenuBar.stories.tsx\\nimport { GraphMenuBar } from \'./GraphMenuBar\'; // Same directory\\n// OR\\nimport { GraphMenuBar } from \'.\'; // From index.tsx\\n```\\n\\n## Migration Checklist\\n\\n### Phase 0: Reorganization (Before Refactoring)\\n- [ ] Create subdirectories for existing components\\n- [ ] Move component files to subdirectories\\n- [ ] Create index.tsx files for each component\\n- [ ] Move stories to component subdirectories\\n- [ ] Create hooks/ subdirectory\\n- [ ] Move hooks to hooks/ subdirectory\\n- [ ] Create hooks/index.ts\\n- [ ] Create utils/ subdirectory (if needed)\\n- [ ] Update all imports in GraphRenderer\\n- [ ] Update all imports in stories\\n- [ ] Update all imports in tests\\n- [ ] **Audit blog posts and docs for Graph component imports**\\n- [ ] **Update import paths in blog posts and docs (if needed)**\\n- [ ] **Build Docusaurus: `make build`**\\n- [ ] **Verify all pages with Graph components render correctly**\\n- [ ] **Test interactive features in blog posts/docs**\\n- [ ] Run tests: `yarn test`\\n- [ ] Run E2E tests: `yarn test:e2e`\\n- [ ] Verify Storybook stories work\\n- [ ] Update Storybook story paths if needed\\n- [ ] Test in Docusaurus\\n- [ ] Code review\\n- [ ] Merge\\n\\n### For Each Refactoring Phase:\\n- [ ] Create new file(s) in appropriate subdirectory\\n- [ ] Move code to new file(s)\\n- [ ] Create index.tsx if new component\\n- [ ] Create stories in component subdirectory\\n- [ ] Update imports in GraphRenderer\\n- [ ] Update imports in stories\\n- [ ] Update imports in tests\\n- [ ] **Build Docusaurus: `make build`**\\n- [ ] **Verify blog posts/docs with Graph components still work**\\n- [ ] **Test interactive features in blog posts/docs**\\n- [ ] Run tests\\n- [ ] Check Storybook stories\\n- [ ] Test in Docusaurus\\n- [ ] Update documentation (if API changes)\\n- [ ] Code review\\n- [ ] Merge\\n\\n## Success Criteria\\n\\n1. \u2705 GraphRenderer.tsx reduced to < 500 lines\\n2. \u2705 All existing functionality preserved\\n3. \u2705 No performance degradation\\n4. \u2705 All tests passing\\n5. \u2705 Storybook stories working\\n6. \u2705 Docusaurus integration working\\n7. \u2705 Code review approved\\n8. \u2705 Documentation updated\\n\\n## Notes\\n\\n- **Incremental Approach**: Each phase is independent and can be merged separately\\n- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing public API\\n- **Type Safety**: Ensure all extracted code is properly typed\\n- **Performance**: Monitor for any performance regressions\\n- **Documentation**: Update JSDoc comments as code moves\\n\\n## Potential Challenges\\n\\n1. **Circular Dependencies**: Watch for circular imports between utilities\\n2. **Hook Dependencies**: Ensure all hook dependencies are correctly passed\\n3. **Ref Management**: Graph ref needs careful handling across hooks\\n4. **State Synchronization**: Ensure state updates don\'t cause infinite loops\\n5. **Event Handler Context**: Ensure event handlers have correct context\\n\\n## Future Improvements (Post-Refactoring)\\n\\n1. Consider extracting ForceGraph2D wrapper to separate component\\n2. Consider using React Context for graph state (if needed)\\n3. Consider memoization optimizations\\n4. Consider TypeScript strict mode improvements\\n5. Consider adding more comprehensive error boundaries\\n\\n## Execution Results / Attempts\\n\\n### \u2705 Work In Progress (2025-11-08 to 2025-11-17)\\n\\n**Work Period:** November 8, 2025 to November 17, 2025\\n\\n**Commits:** 10 commits related to graph component refactoring\\n\\n**Key Accomplishments:**\\n- Initial graph component implementation\\n- Added menu bar to graph component\\n- Made graph component reactive/responsive\\n- Added anchor links to specific nodes in graphs\\n- Added integration and E2E tests for graph component\\n- Checkpointed graph renderer refactoring work\\n- Finalized graph component as part of blog structure overhaul\\n- Revamped graph component with modularization\\n- Added Storybook tab to document components\\n- Improved graph rendering on mobile devices\\n\\n**Notable Commits:**\\n- `a64d629e` (2025-11-08): Updating authors and adding graph component plus stats structures and algos\\n- `7333d884` (2025-11-08): Making graph component reactive\\n- `d2e8bf6d` (2025-11-08): Adding menu bar to graph component\\n- `92e82a04` (2025-11-08): Added ability to have anchor links to specific nodes in specific graphs\\n- `f57ee652` (2025-11-10): Adding integ and e2e tests for graph component\\n- `b5c58a8a` (2025-11-10): Checkpointing graph renderer\\n- `cca8ae25` (2025-11-12): Big blog structure overhaul + finalization of graph component\\n- `e657ebde` (2025-11-12): Revamp to readmes plus fix for graph\\n- `7634d68b` (2025-11-16): Revamping graph component, modularizing it, etc. Also added storybook tab to document components\\n- `6ec4aaac` (2025-11-17): Revamp component setup, story book stories, graph render on mobile, etc\\n\\n**Status:** Work is in progress.

Heatmap rows on left side (flex: 1)\\n  - Legends section on right side (fixed 200px width)\\n  - DateOverlay positioned above rows, spanning only rows width\\n  - Legend section header (\\"Legend\\") aligned with DateOverlay\\n\\n#### Heatmap Visualization\\n- **Two separate heatmap rows**:\\n  - Content row (blue color scheme)\\n  - Development row (green color scheme)\\n  - Each row has its own title and legend on the right\\n  - Shared date overlay (year/quarter headers) above both rows\\n\\n#### Spacing & Alignment\\n- **Quarter gaps**:\\n  - Added 4px gap divs between quarters (matching heatmap squares)\\n  - CSS gap (2px) applies to gap divs, creating 8px total visual gap\\n  - Updated width calculations to account for quarter gaps (8px total)\\n  - Quarter bars align perfectly with heatmap squares below\\n\\n- **Row spacing**:\\n  - Minimal 2px gap between heatmap rows (matching square spacing)\\n  - Minimal 2px gap between legend entries\\n  - Removed excessive padding/margins\\n\\n#### Alignment Fixes\\n- Fixed quarter bar alignment with heatmap squares:\\n  - Accounted for CSS gap (2px) in width calculations\\n  - Quarter gap divs (4px) + CSS gap (2px on each side) = 8px total\\n  - Year and quarter lines span correct widths\\n  - Quarter lines don\'t extend beyond their containers (overflow: hidden)\\n\\n- Fixed legend alignment:\\n  - Legends anchored to top-right (not bottom)\\n  - Added \\"Legend\\" header aligned with DateOverlay\\n  - Proper flex alignment (align-content: flex-start, justify-content: flex-start)\\n\\n#### Date Overlay\\n- Year labels and lines span full year width (including quarter gaps)\\n- Quarter labels and lines span individual quarter widths\\n- Proper positioning above heatmap rows\\n- Gap divs match heatmap row structure exactly\\n- Year labels use Highlight component with gradient background\\n- Year line positioned behind year label (z-index: 0)\\n\\n#### Additional Enhancements\\n- **Dynamic Date Range**: Always shows 1 year ago, this year, and next year (dynamically calculated)\\n- **Current Month Indicator**: Added to legend with bordered square and month/year label\\n- **Year Highlighting**: Year labels use Highlight component for visual emphasis\\n- **Legend Header**: \\"Legend\\" header anchored to top-right with minimal vertical space\\n\\n**Components Created:**\\n- **`src/components/Changelog/Changelog.tsx`** - Main component orchestrating all sub-components\\n- **`src/components/Changelog/DateOverlay/DateOverlay.tsx`** - Year and quarter headers\\n- **`src/components/Changelog/HeatmapRow/HeatmapRow.tsx`** -

**Timeline bar**: Horizontal line spanning full width (2px height, gray background)\\n  - **Inception dot**: Primary color dot positioned at left (0%) on the bar\\n  - **Execution dot**: Success color dot positioned at right (100%) on the bar (only shown if execution date exists)\\n  - **Duration label**: Centered on the bar, showing time between inception and execution\\n  - **Date labels**: Displayed below the bar, aligned with their respective dots\\n\\n#### Visual Layout Structure\\n```\\n[\u25cf\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 5 days \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25cf]\\nInception                                    Execution\\nJan 15, 2025                            Jan 20, 2025\\n```\\n\\n**Layout Components:**\\n1. **Timeline Bar** (`.timelineBar`):\\n   - Horizontal line (2px height) spanning full width\\n   - Gray background (`var(--ifm-color-emphasis-300)`)\\n   - Position: relative container for absolutely positioned dots\\n\\n2. **Timeline Dots** (`.timelineDotContainer`):\\n   - **Inception dot**: Absolutely positioned at `left: 0` (start of bar)\\n     - Primary color (`var(--ifm-color-primary)`)\\n     - 10px diameter (8px on mobile)\\n     - 2px border (1.5px on mobile)\\n   - **Execution dot**: Absolutely positioned at `right: 0` (end of bar)\\n     - Success color (`var(--ifm-color-success)`) when execution date exists\\n     - Muted gray color (`var(--ifm-color-emphasis-400)`) with reduced opacity when execution is TBD\\n     - Same size as inception dot\\n     - **Always rendered** - shows even when execution date is \\"TBD\\" or \\"XX\\"\\n\\n3. **Duration Label** (`.timelineDuration`):\\n   - Centered on the bar (`left: 50%`, `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)`)\\n   - Background matches page background (appears above bar)\\n   - Shows calculated duration or \\"X days thus far\\" for TBD execution\\n   - Font: `0.7rem` (`0.65rem` on mobile), font-weight: 600\\n\\n4. **Date Labels** (`.timelineDates`):\\n   - Row below the bar, flex layout with space-between\\n   - **Inception date**: Left-aligned under inception dot\\n   - **Execution date**: Right-aligned under execution dot (always shown)\\n   - Each date item contains:\\n     - **Label**: \\"INCEPTION\\" or \\"EXECUTION\\" (uppercase, `0.65rem`, `0.6rem` on mobile)\\n     - **Date**: Formatted date string (`0.75rem`, `0.7rem` on mobile) or \\"TBD\\" if execution date is TBD\\n\\n#### Duration Calculation\\n- **Smart duration formatting**:\\n  - **TBD execution**: Shows \\"X days thus far\\" (calculated from inception to today)\\n  - **Completed execution**: Shows duration between inception and execution dates\\n  - **Duration formats**:\\n    - \\"Same day\\" if 0 days\\n    - \\"X days\\" if < 7 days\\n    - \\"X weeks\\" if < 30 days\\n    - \\"X months\\" if < 365 days\\n    - \\"X years, Y months\\" if >= 1 year\\n  - Handles invalid dates gracefully (returns \\"TBD\\")\\n- **Visual indication for TBD execution**:\\n  - Execution dot always visible (even when TBD)\\n  - TBD execution dot uses muted gray color with reduced opacity (`.timelineDotTBD`)\\n  - Execution date label shows \\"TBD\\" instead of formatted date\\n  - Duration shows \\"X days thus far\\" to indicate ongoing work\\n\\n#### Date Formatting\\n- **Smart date formatting**:\\n  - Handles \\"TBD\\" and \\"XX\\" dates gracefully (replaces \\"XX\\" with \\"??\\")\\n  - Formats dates as \\"Jan 15, 2025\\" (month short, day numeric, year numeric)\\n  - Falls back to original string if date parsing fails\\n\\n#### Responsive Design\\n- **Mobile optimization**:\\n  - Thinner bar: `2px` \u2192 `1.5px` height on mobile\\n  - Smaller dots: `10px` \u2192 `8px` diameter on mobile\\n  - Thinner borders: `2px` \u2192 `1.5px` on mobile\\n  - Smaller duration label: `0.7rem` \u2192 `0.65rem` on mobile\\n  - Smaller date fonts: `0.75rem` \u2192 `0.7rem` for dates, `0.65rem` \u2192 `0.6rem` for labels\\n  - Tighter spacing: `0.5rem` \u2192 `0.375rem` gap\\n  - Reduced padding on duration label: `0.125rem 0.375rem` \u2192 `0.1rem 0.25rem`\\n\\n#### Integration\\n- **Replaced text-based dates** in `QuarterSection`:\\n  - Removed separate \\"Inception:\\" and \\"Execution:\\" text spans\\n  - Integrated `EntryTimeline` component into `entryMeta` section\\n  - Timeline aligns properly with other meta items (component name, etc.)\\n  - Works seamlessly with horizontal meta layout on mobile\\n\\n**Components Created:**\\n- **`src/components/Changelog/EntryTimeline/EntryTimeline.tsx`** - Timeline component with duration calculation\\n- **`src/components/Changelog/EntryTimeline/EntryTimeline.module.css`** -

**Plugin ID**: `changelog` (unique identifier for multi-instance plugin, similar to blog plugin\'s `id: \'designs\'`)\\n  - **Path**: `./changelog` (points to changelog directory, no file copying required)\\n  - **Route Base Path**: `changelog` (files accessible at `/changelog/...`)\\n  - **Sidebar Configuration**: `sidebarPath: false` (no sidebar needed for changelog entries)\\n  - **Edit URL**: Points to GitHub for easy editing\\n  - **Uses built-in Docusaurus plugin**: Follows same pattern as `@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog` for multiple instances\\n\\n#### Why Docs Plugin Instead of Pages Plugin\\n- **Pages plugin limitation**: `@docusaurus/plugin-content-pages` doesn\'t support multiple instances (unlike blog/docs plugins)\\n- **Docs plugin advantage**: `@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs` supports multiple instances with `id` field, just like blog plugin\\n- **No file copying required**: Files served directly from `changelog/` directory (like blog serves from `designs/`)\\n- **Proper MDX rendering**: Full markdown content rendered with Docusaurus MDX features and frontmatter support\\n\\n#### Link Generation Fix\\n- **Fixed broken changelog entry links**:\\n  - Previously linked to GitHub (temporary workaround)\\n  - Now links to `/changelog/${slug}` (proper Docusaurus routes)\\n  - Preserves subdirectory structure in URLs (e.g., `/changelog/development/2025-01-15-...`)\\n  - Links work correctly for both content and development entries\\n\\n#### Benefits\\n- **Changelog entries are now accessible as pages**:\\n  - Full markdown content rendered with Docusaurus MDX features\\n  - Frontmatter properly parsed and displayed\\n  - Edit links point to GitHub for easy updates\\n  - Proper routing and navigation within Docusaurus site\\n  - SEO-friendly URLs\\n  - No file copying or custom plugins required\\n  - Uses standard Docusaurus plugin pattern (same as blog plugin)\\n\\n**Configuration Files Modified:**\\n- **`docusaurus.config.js`**: Added changelog docs plugin configuration (follows blog plugin pattern)\\n- **`src/pages/changelog.tsx`**: Updated `getEntryUrl` to use proper routes\\n\\n**Example URLs:**\\n- `/changelog/development/2025-01-15-component-creation-svg-kanban`\\n- `/changelog/content/2025-XX-XX-content-post-knowledge-agents-design`\\n\\n**Configuration Pattern:**\\n```javascript\\n[\\n  \'@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs\',\\n  {\\n    id: \'changelog\',  // Multi-instance support (like blog plugin)\\n    path: \'./changelog\',\\n    routeBasePath: \'changelog\',\\n    sidebarPath: false,\\n    editUrl: \'https://github.com/.../changelog/\',\\n  },\\n]\\n```\\n\\n**Status:** Changelog component has been successfully created and refined with modular architecture, proper alignment, GitHub-style heatmap visualization, dynamic date range, year highlighting, current month indicator, mobile responsiveness, timeline visualization, and proper Docusaurus routing. The component is production-ready and maintains clean separation of concerns. Storybook stories and documentation are complete. All changelog entries are now accessible as pages with proper routing."},{"id":"/2025/11/16/development/mechanic-establishment-storybook","metadata":{"permalink":"/changelog/2025/11/16/development/mechanic-establishment-storybook","editUrl":"https://github.com/omars-lab/omars-lab.github.io/edit/master/bytesofpurpose-blog/changelog/changelog/development/2025-11-16-mechanic-establishment-storybook.md","source":"@site/changelog/development/2025-11-16-mechanic-establishment-storybook.md","title":"Blogging Mechanism - Storybook Component Documentation","description":"Establish Storybook as a component development and documentation tool integrated into the blog","date":"2025-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":1.01,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Blogging Mechanism - Storybook Component Documentation","description":"Establish Storybook as a component development and documentation tool integrated into the blog","status":"completed","inception_date":"2025-11-16","execution_date":"2025-11-17","type":"feature","component":"Infrastructure","priority":"high"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Component Creation - Changelog Component","permalink":"/changelog/2025/11/16/development/component-creation-changelog-component"},"nextItem":{"title":"Graph Renderer Component Creation","permalink":"/changelog/2025/11/13/development/component-creation-graph-renderer"}},"content":"## Execution Plan\\n\\nEstablish Storybook as a component development and documentation tool for the blog, enabling:\\n- Interactive component documentation\\n- Component development environment\\n- Visual component testing\\n- Integration with blog navigation\\n- Static site generation for production\\n\\n## Execution Results / Attempts\\n\\n### \u2705 Storybook Established (2025-11-16 to 2025-11-17)\\n\\n**Work Period:** November 16, 2025 to November 17, 2025\\n\\n**Commits:** 2 commits related to Storybook integration\\n\\n**Key Accomplishments:**\\n- Integrated Storybook into blog build process\\n- Added Storybook tab to blog navigation\\n- Set up Storybook for component documentation\\n- Configured Storybook for static site generation\\n- Created initial Storybook stories for Graph components\\n\\n**Notable Commits:**\\n- `7634d68b` (2025-11-16): Revamping graph component, modularizing it, etc. Also added storybook tab to document components\\n- `6ec4aaac` (2025-11-17): Revamp component setup, story book stories, graph render on mobile, etc\\n\\n**Features Implemented:**\\n- Storybook development server integration\\n- Static Storybook build integrated into Docusaurus build\\n- Storybook accessible via `/storybook/` route\\n- Component stories for Graph components\\n- Webpack configuration for Docusaurus module mocking\\n- Storybook addons configured (essentials, interactions, links)\\n\\n**Status:** Storybook has been successfully integrated into the blog infrastructure.
